# CodeWords Chrome Extension

## What is it for?

The CodeWords Chrome Extension allows a CodeWords workflow to use your session cookies to perform actions, e.g. scraping, input data, on any websites that may require your login.&#x20;

This means you can have a workflow scrape data on LinkedIn (see [LinkedIn Profile Enrichment](https://codewords.agemo.ai/workflow/linkedin_profile_enrichment_to_gsheet) as an example) on your behalf as if you were doing it manually.
