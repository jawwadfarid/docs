<details>

<summary>Is this compliant with LinkedIn’s policies?</summary>

Yes. The workflow scrapes publicly available data from non-authenticated LinkedIn views, staying compliant with LinkedIn’s Terms of Service.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Will people know I viewed their profile?</summary>

That depends on **their privacy settings** and whether you have LinkedIn open in an active browser window. Some users may see a profile view if their settings show all visitors. If you're concerned, we recommend using LinkedIn in private or logged-out mode.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How many profiles can it scrape from one post?</summary>

Up to **250 profiles per post** for now. We're working on increasing that limit soon. This cap is in place to stay within LinkedIn usage boundaries and ensure compliance with their ToS.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I use this on posts I didn’t publish myself?</summary>

Yes—any **public** LinkedIn post can be scraped, regardless of who posted it.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I choose what data gets extracted?</summary>

Absolutely. You can check off the standard fields you want (e.g., job title, company) and also add free-text instructions for custom enrichment.

<summary>What if I get an error or it's returning false results?</summary>
