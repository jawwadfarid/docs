On CodeWords, there are two types of credits: Build credits and Run credits.

## Build credits

One build credit is charged only when you "Publish" your function. Iterate in [Wordshop](wordshop.md) until you're happy with result.

On the Free Plan, you get 10 Build credits. More credits and features are available in the Pro plan.

## Run credits

Run credits are charged when a published function is executed. The cost of running a function varies based on the components of the function. For instance, if the function uses a third-party API, the cost of running the API will be part of the total function run cost.

On the Free Plan, you get $5 of Run credits. More credits and features are available in the Pro plan.
