### What is a CodeWords function?

A CodeWords function is a generated or existing block that comprises code, integrations, a storage system and/or third-party services.&#x20;

CodeWords functions can become part of other functions to generate more complex ones. Think of them as LEGO blocks.

Functions can be used as part of an automation workflow, custom tool or via an API call.

### What is a built-in function?

A built-in function is a proprietary  function made available to CodeWords users. For instance, GPT-based AI is a versatile AI model that can be used for text processing, summarization, Q\&A and much more.

Below is the table of the built-in functions available for users to build upon.
