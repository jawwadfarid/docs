## What is Wordshop?&#x20;

Wordshop is the all-in-one creation environment where you can

* Craft your function Spec
* Build and iterate on your CodeWords function
* Test it in Demo
* Publish your function

Wordshop is the creation environment designed for non-developers to build software with their own words.&#x20;

**Focus on what, now how**. It is a new experience where your job is to provide details about what you want to be done, and let CodeWords figure out how.

**Build, demo and iterate.** Launch a build for each spec and demo it. Modify the spec manually or from the Chat if there are any revisions to be made. Build again until you're happy with the output.
