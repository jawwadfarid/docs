# Spec

## What is a Spec

A Spec is a high-level description of a function. It provides details about the inputs and outputs of the function, and the steps that will be taken to implement it. As a CodeWords user, your job is to craft the Spec that fits your needs using your own words.

Each function has its own Spec. You can think of it like a project brief or a product requirements documents of a tool to be implemented on CodeWords. No need to write or share code anymore; on CodeWords, it's all about the Spec.
