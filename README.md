# Introduction

## What is CodeWords?

CodeWords is an AI-native platform for building workflow automations. A user describes their requirements in a natural language prompt, which our workflow automation agent, Cody, uses to build and deploy the automation.

* **Natural Language Interface**: Translate English prompts into executable workflows.
* **Extensive Integrations**: Natively connect with a library of over 2,000 applications.
* **Embedded AI**: Utilize built-in AI models for advanced automation tasks.
* **Browser Extension**: Build and manage automations directly within your browser using the CodeWords Chrome extension.

## How CodeWords works

CodeWords lowers the technical barrier to building workflow automations. _"I want to automatically save email attachments to Google Drive and notify my team on Slack" -_ Cody handles the technical details to make it happen.

* **For everyday users**, CodeWords replaces tedious manual work with intelligent automations. Think of it as Zapier's connectivity with ChatGPT's conversational ease.
* **For technical builders**, CodeWords collapses traditional development cycles into minutes. Itâ€™s like having Cursor's speed, but for creating workflows instead of code.
