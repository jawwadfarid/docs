# Overview

CodeWords is the idea-to-software platform that turns your digital ideas into tools. Whether you are a software developer or not, you can build software in minutes.

CodeWords is best for people who have an idea of what software they want to build but do not know where or how to start.

* **Create**. Users can build complex back-end systems in minutes from a prompt. These are called “CodeWords functions”. Check out the prompting [Best Practices](https://www.notion.so/CodeWords-Documentation-136c873bb9c7406d8ebf5ac8c4b5dcba?pvs=21) and the [Example Library](https://www.notion.so/CodeWords-Documentation-136c873bb9c7406d8ebf5ac8c4b5dcba?pvs=21) to see what is possible.
* **Manage**. Everything you create on CodeWords lives in your own library under “My Functions”.
* **Compose**. The real power of CodeWords comes from the ability to compose multiple functions with each other to build more complex software. Like assembling LEGO blocks.
* **Run.** Every function is automatically deployed on the cloud in one-click, allowing users to use the created software directly.
* **API.** Functions are made available via the Run page and can be integrated anywhere. See [API Reference](https://www.notion.so/CodeWords-Documentation-136c873bb9c7406d8ebf5ac8c4b5dcba?pvs=21) for more information.
