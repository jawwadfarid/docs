CodeWords is the **idea-to-software platform that turns your ideas into working tools**. Whether you are a software developer, product manager or tinkerer, CodeWords allows you to build reusable and composable software in minutes.

CodeWords is best for people who have an idea of what software they want to build, but do not know where or how to start. **Use your own words to describe** what you want to build and iterate alongside the AI Builder.

## Why use CodeWords ?

With CodeWords, anyone can turn an idea into working software in minutes. CodeWords handles the scoping, orchestration, implementation and deployment of your tool for you, as if you had a team of 10x engineers working for you.

The output is always 100% executable software, usable in a UI or via an API.

## What is a CodeWords function?

A CodeWords function is a generated or existing block that can be composed of code, integrations, a storage system and third-party services.&#x20;

CodeWords functions can become part of other functions to generate more complex ones. Think of them as LEGO blocks.

Functions can be used as part of an automation workflow, custom tool or via an API call.

## What can you build on CodeWords?

* **Workflows**: an automated multi-step process that can include multiple APIs, integrations and CodeWords functions. Run it on CodeWords or schedule it.
* **Back-end systems**: the backbone of any software composed of code, integrations and databases. Test it in the generated UI or use it via an API with the CodeWords client.
* **Full-stack apps**: coming soon
