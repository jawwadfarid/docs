# Introduction

### What is Codewords?

Codewords is an AI-powered platform that transforms how you build, deploy, and manage workflow automations. Instead of wrestling with complex interfaces or writing code, you simply describe what you need in plain English.

#### The Magic Behind the Platform

At its core, Codewords bridges the gap between intention and execution. You bring the vision—"I want to automatically save email attachments to Google Drive and notify my team"—and our AI handles the technical complexity of making it happen.

**For everyday users**, Codewords replaces tedious manual work with intelligent automations. Think Zapier's connectivity meets ChatGPT's conversational ease.

**For technical builders**, Codewords collapses traditional development cycles into minutes. Imagine having Cursor's speed, but for workflow automation instead of code.

### Understanding Workflows

A **workflow** is your digital assistant—a sequence of connected steps that execute automatically when triggered. Think of it as a recipe that follows itself.

#### A Day in the Life: Sales Lead Processing

Let's walk through a common scenario that illustrates the power of automation:

**The Old Way (Manual):** Every time a new sales inquiry arrives via email with an attachment, someone needs to:

1. **Save** the attachment to the correct Google Drive folder
2. **Notify** the sales team via Slack
3. **Schedule** a follow-up reminder
4. **Update** the master lead tracking spreadsheet

This process takes 10-15 minutes per lead, is prone to human error, and often gets delayed during busy periods.

**The Codewords Way (Automated):** The moment that email hits your inbox, your workflow springs into action:

* Attachment automatically saved to the right folder
* Sales team gets an instant, formatted Slack notification
* Follow-up reminder appears in your calendar
* Spreadsheet updates with all relevant details

**Result:** What once took 15 minutes of focused attention now happens in seconds, every time, without fail.
