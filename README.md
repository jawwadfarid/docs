# Introduction

#### Introduction to Codewords

Welcome to the internal documentation for Codewords. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the platform, its core concepts, and its target users. The goal is to equip you with the foundational knowledge needed to build, support, and innovate on the Codewords platform.

***

#### 1. What is Codewords?

Codewords is an AI-powered platform for building, deploying, and managing workflow automations through a conversational interface.

It allows users to connect their favourite applications, inject custom logic and AI models, and automate repetitive tasks. Unlike traditional automation tools, Codewords enables users to generate production-grade, multi-step workflows simply by describing their needs in a chat.

The core value proposition can be understood through two key lenses:

* For Non-Technical Users: It replaces manual tasks with a powerful, centralised library of AI-driven workflows. If a specific automation doesn't exist, users can create it conversationally. It combines the connectivity of Zapier with the intuitive, natural language interface of ChatGPT.
* For Technical Builders: It dramatically shortens the development cycle by collapsing the specification, building, and deployment phases into a single interface. Builders can deliver robust automations in minutes without managing boilerplate code or infrastructure. Think of it as Cursor, but for workflow automation.

#### 2. Core Concept: Workflows

A workflow is a sequence of connected steps that execute automatically to complete a task. Think of it as a recipe for getting digital work done.

A Real-World Example:

Imagine a common manual process: receiving a new sales lead via an email with an attachment.

1. Manual Step 1: Save the attachment to a specific Google Drive folder.
2. Manual Step 2: Send a Slack message to the `#sales` channel about the new lead.
3. Manual Step 3: Add a reminder to your calendar to follow up.
4. Manual Step 4: Update a master spreadsheet with the lead's details.

Instead of performing these four manual steps every time, a Codewords workflow automates the entire sequence the moment the email arrives. This saves time, reduces errors, and allows the user to focus on higher-value work.
