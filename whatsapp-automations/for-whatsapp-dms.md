### Setting Up Your First DM Assistant

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Build the Assistant through chat

Describe the kind of WhatsApp assistant you want to create along with its trigger.

Example: "Create a WhatsApp assistant that’s connected to an LLM and automatically responds to any message that I send back. Also make sure that its connected to my google calendar, such that It has access to view, edit, list and create events on my calendar. "
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Provide your phone number

Cody will ask which phone number you want your AI assistant to connect to. Once connected and the Assistant is built your Assistant will send you a welcome message.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Test your Assistant

Send any message — the assistant will detect it and respond through your Custom WhatsApp DM Assistant.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
