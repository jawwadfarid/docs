<details>

<summary>Do I need coding experience to follow this tutorial?</summary>

No. Everything in this guide can be done with plain English prompts. CodeWords automatically builds the logic, connects integrations, and handles deployment behind the scenes.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How long will this take to complete?</summary>

Most users finish in under 10 minutes. The workflow setup is intentionally short: add your URL, let CodeWords summarize the content with AI, and send the result to your inbox.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What kind of web pages work best?</summary>

You can use any publicly accessible, text-based website — like blog posts, articles, or documentation pages. Avoid paywalled or login-protected pages. If you would like to run it on paywalled or login-protected pages you can use our[ Chrome extension](https://docs.codewords.ai/web-automation/chrome-extension) or [Web Agent](https://docs.codewords.ai/web-automation/web-agent) to access these data.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I customize what gets summarized or how the email looks?</summary>

Yes. You can adjust the AI prompt (“write a short summary,” “list three key points,” etc.) and change the email recipient, subject, or format in the workflow editor.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What if something doesn’t work as expected?</summary>

Check that your connected apps (Gmail, Web Agent) are authorized and active. Then open the Run Logs inside CodeWords to see detailed errors. The Troubleshooting Guide
