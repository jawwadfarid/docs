# AI models

To get started with AI model selection, it's important to understand the three main categories of models available. Each category serves different purposes and excels at different types of tasks.

Once you understand these categories, you'll be able to match the right model to your specific workflow requirements.

The key is matching the model's capabilities to your task complexity and speed requirements!

**The Speed  Models (For quick, simple tasks)** These models are optimized for speed and efficiency, making them perfect for high-volume, straightforward operations

* **gpt-4o-mini** - Super fast processing, excellent for simple data extractions and repetitive automation work
* **claude-haiku** - Lightning quick responses that are perfect for basic classification and simple text processing tasks
* **gemini-flash-lite** - The most cost-effective option that handles simple parsing and basic operations exceptionally well
* Use these when you need to process large volumes of simple tasks quickly
* Great for initial data sorting and basic text manipulation
* Perfect for workflows that run frequently throughout the day

**The Balanced Models (For most everyday work)** The reliable workhorses that handle the majority of your automation needs with consistent quality

* **gpt-4o** - The dependable all-rounder that handles most workflow tasks with solid performance across the board
* **claude-sonnet** - Exceptional at understanding context and nuance, making it ideal for more sophisticated text analysis
* **gemini-flash** - Outstanding value proposition with good performance across all types of automation tasks
* These are your go-to models for standard workflow automation
* Perfect for content creation, moderate analysis, and general processing tasks
* The sweet spot between speed and intelligence for most use cases

**The Deep Thinker Models (For complex, important work)** When you need the highest level of reasoning and analysis for critical automation workflows

* **o3** - The most advanced reasoner available, use this for workflows requiring complex problem-solving and multi-step logic
* **claude-opus** - Exceptional at complex analysis, deep understanding, and handling nuanced automation requirements
* **gemini-pro** - Can process and analyze huge amounts of information simultaneously, perfect for large-scale data workflows
* Reserve these for your most important and complex automations
* Use when accuracy and sophisticated reasoning are more important than speed
* Best for final analysis, complex decision-making, and critical business processes

**Simple Strategy: Match the AI to Your Task**

The key to successful workflow automation is choosing the right model for each step of your process.

Use this straightforward approach:

* **Simple data extraction and parsing** → Deploy the Speed models for quick processing
* **Content creation and standard analysis** → Rely on the Balanced models for consistent results
* **Complex reasoning and critical decisions** → Trust the Deep Thinkers for sophisticated analysis
* **Processing large datasets** → Mix and match strategically (use fast models for initial sorting, then smart models for final analysis)

**Best Practices**

Start with simpler models and upgrade only when needed. Often a Speed models can handle 80% of your workflow, with a Deep Thinker handling just the final analysis step.

Consider the cost-benefit ratio. Speed models cost significantly less, so use them wherever possible in your automation pipeline.
