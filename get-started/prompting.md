# Prompting

CodeWords makes it simple by allowing you to build a workflow with prompts:

* Describe what you want to build in the chat box
* The more specific you are, the better the results will be
* Start with a clear and detailed description of what you want to build
* Even if you don't have a clear idea, CodeWords will help you in the process
* Once you have given a prompt, CodeWords will ask a few simple questions to help you refine the automation that you want to build
* You can refine or edit it as you go

{% hint style="info" %}
_"Create a workflow that will label all my emails in my Gmail inbox every 30 minutes."_
{% endhint %}
