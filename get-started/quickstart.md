# Quickstart

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyLI2FElTH0" %}

1. **Visit** [**codewords.agemo.ai/login**](https://codewords.agemo.ai/login) and sign in
2. **Start a new chat** to create your first automation
3. **Describe your automation idea** in natural language (or ask Cody for ideas!)&#x20;
4. **Review the output** and iterate as needed by asking in the chat



### Prompt: Describe your idea <a href="#prompt-describe-your-idea" id="prompt-describe-your-idea"></a>

Head to the chat interface and start by describing what you want to build in natural language. CodeWords will clarify the automation idea with you and build it end-to-end.&#x20;

Try these simple prompts to get started:

* **"A workflow that monitors feature launches on my competitor websites"**
* **"A workflow that extracts the transcript from YouTube videos"**
* **"A workflow that enriches my LinkedIn name list with contact info"**
* **"A workflow that sends this form when someone submits an inquiry"**



### Iterate: Refine your automation <a href="#iterate-refine-your-application" id="iterate-refine-your-application"></a>

Once CodeWords has built your automation, you can iterate, update, and improve it through conversation.

For example:

* **Change the output destination** to a different app (e.g., Slack)&#x20;
* **Add further conditions** to your workflow automation&#x20;
* **Ask for changes** in natural language: "Add a email addresses to the enrichment process"&#x20;



### Testing, debugging, and deploying  <a href="#iterate-refine-your-application" id="iterate-refine-your-application"></a>

CodeWords builds and develops your workflow automation end-to-end.&#x20;

What this means:&#x20;

* **Testing:** CodeWords tests your workflow at every stage.&#x20;
* **Debugging:** When CodeWords detects an error, it automatically starts debugging the issue and continues doing this until it finds and implements a solution.&#x20;
* **Deploying:** After you've confirmed you're happy with the built automation, CodeWords will deploy it for you. When something is deployed, you'll see CodeWords confetti!&#x20;

### Views <a href="#iterate-refine-your-application" id="iterate-refine-your-application"></a>

#### Graph view&#x20;

When you're building an automation in the chat, CodeWords will generate a graph view that contains all the nodes and conditions. Other tools would usually require you to drag, drop, and configure these nodes. Instead, CodeWords builds them for you end-to-end.&#x20;

Click an integration node to connect to that integration in a couple of clicks.&#x20;

#### Code view&#x20;

Whilst CodeWords builds your automation, it also writes the code for you.&#x20;

Click the code view at the top of the graph section to see your workflow's code.&#x20;

You can also export it.&#x20;

### Chat mode <a href="#iterate-refine-your-application" id="iterate-refine-your-application"></a>

Sometimes you might want to use CodeWords for web scraping, as a chat, or without building a workflow automation.&#x20;

You can declutter your chat view by clicking `Chat only view` and expand the chat area.&#x20;

### Templates <a href="#iterate-refine-your-application" id="iterate-refine-your-application"></a>

CodeWords templates are pre-built workflow automations that are ready for you to use.&#x20;

Clicking on a template will take you straight to its run page. Here you can add custom inputs to run the workflow, or you can click the `Edit` button to update it or customize it for your use case.&#x20;

There are two main locations where you can access automation templates:

* **Template Gallery** - This contains all the pre-built automations from the CodeWords community.&#x20;
* **My Workflows** - These are all your automations. When you finish building an automation with CodeWords, you'll be given a URL that takes you straight to your workflow run page. You can access all of these here.&#x20;

### AI Models <a href="#iterate-refine-your-application" id="iterate-refine-your-application"></a>

CodeWords gives you access to all the latest AI models.&#x20;

You can ask Cody in the chat interface to use a specific AI model. For example, if you'd prefer to use Claude for your output, you can do so by asking while you're building that automation.&#x20;

CodeWords has access to a growing number of AI models, including:&#x20;

* Anthropic models (Claude Opus, Claude Sonnet, Claude Haiku, etc.)&#x20;
* OpenAI models (GPT 4.1, 5, etc.)&#x20;
* Google Gemini models (e.g., for text generation, image generation, and video generation, etc.)

You can ask Cody in the chat if you're wondering whether CodeWords has access to a specific AI model.&#x20;



### FAQs

<details>

<summary>Do I need coding experience to use CodeWords?</summary>

No. Everything in this guide can be done with plain English prompts. CodeWords automatically builds the logic, connects integrations, and handles deployment behind the scenes.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How long does it take to learn CodeWords? </summary>

Most users learn and build their first automation in under 10 minutes. CodeWords has been designed so there's no learning curve for users, regardless of technical background.&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary>What kind of web pages work best for web scraping?</summary>

You can use any publicly accessible, text-based website — like blog posts, articles, or documentation pages. Avoid paywalled or login-protected pages. If you would like to run web scraping on paywalled or login-protected pages you can use the CodeWords[ Chrome extension](https://docs.codewords.ai/web-automation/chrome-extension) or [Web Agent](https://docs.codewords.ai/web-automation/web-agent) to access the page's data.

<details>

<summary>Can I customize what gets summarized or how the output looks?</summary>

Yes. You can adjust the AI prompt to change what the output looks like. For example: “write a short summary,” “list three key points,” etc.

You can also change the details according to your workflow type. For example, if your workflow output is an email, you can change the email recipient, subject, or format from the workflow chat.&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary>What if something doesn’t work as expected?</summary>

Check that your connected apps and integrations (Gmail, Web Agent) are authorized and active.  \
\
You can also ask Cody, the CodeWords AI automation assistant, to check what's not working. Provide the context about the error, and ask Cody to fix it from the chat interface.&#x20;
