# Pricing

### How it works

CodeWords uses a usage-based pricing model designed to be fair, flexible, and scalable.\
When you sign up, you’ll receive $5 in free credits to start building and testing automations — no upfront payment required.

Our pricing reflects real compute and integration costs. You only pay for what you use — whether that’s generating workflows with Cody, running automations, or connecting with external tools and APIs.

> Think of credits as the fuel that powers your automations — every action, from updating a spreadsheet to running an AI agent, uses a small amount of it.

### Credits & Usage

Each workflow action consumes credits depending on its complexity:

* Simple tasks (like sending a message or updating a cell) use fewer credits
* Complex tasks (like AI summarization, web automation, or external integrations) use more credits

It’s a pay-as-you-go system that automatically scales with your usage.

**Detailed history:** To see exactly what you’ve spent, visit the [History Page](https://codewords.agemo.ai/workflows/history) — you’ll find the cost of each workflow run and how much was used to build it through Cody’s chat.

### Typical Costs

#### Building Automations

Creating workflows or AI Agents through conversations with Cody.\
**Average cost:** $0.50 – $2 per automation\
More complex builds (involving AI or APIs) may cost slightly more.

#### Editing Automations

Updating or customizing existing templates or workflows.\
**Average cost:** $0.10 – $1 per edit\
Complex edits (e.g., multi-step logic changes) may use additional credits.

#### Running Automations

Executing your workflows — whether manually, scheduled, or triggered.\
**Average cost:** $0.00001 – $1 per run\
The final cost depends on your workflow’s steps, API calls, and integrations.

> You can cancel any scheduled or triggered automations anytime.\
> In rare cases, minimal overspill charges may apply while cancellation completes.

### How Credits Work

* **Automatic usage:** Credits are deducted automatically whenever your workflows run or when you chat with Cody.
* **Real-time balance:** View your remaining balance [Account](https://codewords.agemo.ai/account) → [Wallet](https://codewords.agemo.ai/account/wallet)**.**
* **Detailed history:** To see exactly what you’ve spent, visit the [History Page](https://codewords.agemo.ai/workflows/history) — you’ll find the cost of each workflow run and how much was used to build it through Cody’s chat.
* **No idle costs:** You only pay when something actually runs or builds.

### Early Access Pricing

CodeWords is still evolving — and so is our pricing flexibility.\
For now, we’re keeping rates low to encourage you to experiment, explore, and build freely.

This early-access model means you can test AI, workflows, and integrations at a fraction of the cost of traditional automation tools.

### Summary

* $5 free credits when you sign up
* Pay only for what you use — no subscriptions or contracts
* Transparent usage history and cost tracking
* Cancel automations anytime
* Early-access rates so you can build more for less
