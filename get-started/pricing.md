# Pricing

### How CodeWords pricing works

CodeWords offers two types of pricing models:&#x20;

* **Usage-based**: A credit-based system that let's you pay as you go.&#x20;
* **Subscription plans**: Charged monthly. Receive a regular top-up so you can keep building.&#x20;
* **Manual top-ups**: You can manually top-up your account whenever you like, whether you're on a subscription plan or just paying as you go.&#x20;

As of February 2026, when you subscribe to CodeWords we'll add bonus credits to your account every month, completely on us. Here's how it works:

* **Free Plan:** Get what you pay for
* **Pro Plan ($20/month):** Get $30 of credits (50% bonus)
* **Business Plan ($100/month):** Get $200 of credits (100% bonus)

**Plus, subscribers get bonus credits on all manual top-ups.**&#x20;

For every $10 you top up, Pro users get $15 worth of credits, and Max users get $20.\
\
You can also subscribe to the **Annual Subscription** (17% Discount):

* **Pro Plan ($200/Year):** Get $300 of credits
* **Business Plan ($1000/Year):** Get $2000 of credits

#### Free credits for new users

When you sign up, you automatically receive $5 in free credits.

Use them to test, build, and run automations with zero commitment and no payment card required.&#x20;

#### Custom - Enterprise

For more extensive automation usage.&#x20;

Email **support@agemo.ai** for pricing options, dedicated support, and custom arrangements.

### What credits are and how they work

Every action, whether building with Cody or running a workflow, consumes a small amount of credits. Credit usage is based on token consumption.&#x20;

#### Credits are used when you:

* Build automations through chat with Cody
* Edit existing workflows
* Run workflows (manual, scheduled, or triggered)
* Use AI, external APIs, or web automation

After you've first run a workflow, you'll be able to see its estimated cost per run from the run page.&#x20;

There are no idle fees or background charges.&#x20;

We're constantly working on making our pricing more transparent.

You can check your real-time balance anytime in the bottom-left of your screen, or by clicking `Account` and heading to your [Wallet](https://codewords.agemo.ai/account/wallet).

Creating workflows or AI Agents through conversations with Cody.

* **Typical cost:** $0.50–$2 per automation
* More complex logic / API workflows may cost slightly more

#### Editing automations

Updating or customizing an existing workflow or template.

* **Typical cost:** $0.10–$1 per edit
* Multi-step logic or advanced changes may use additional credits

#### Running automations

Workflow runs (manual, triggered, or scheduled)

  * Number of steps
  * API calls

### Wallet and top-ups

Once you are subscribed you can add more credits to you account.

This allows you to get the most out of CodeWords, without paying for anything you don't use.&#x20;

#### To top up:

1. Go to **Settings →** [**Wallet**](https://codewords.agemo.ai/account/wallet)
2. Click **Top up**&#x20;
3. Choose a preset amount or enter a custom amount (min $5)
4. Credits will appear instantly

Top-ups are perfect if you prefer pay-as-you-go or need extra credits beyond your subscription.



### Credit rollover, expiration, and refund queries&#x20;

* Free Credits: One-time free credits are granted to new users who have signed up to CodeWords.&#x20;
* Monthly Plans: Unused credits from your monthly subscription continue to roll over to subsequent billing periods. You can manually top-up your credits, cancel or downgrade your subscription at any time.&#x20;

Credits are prepaid, non-refundable, and non-redeemable for cash or any other value, as is the industry standard.&#x20;
