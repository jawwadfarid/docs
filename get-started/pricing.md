# Pricing

### How CodeWords pricing works

CodeWords offers two types of pricing models:&#x20;

* **Usage-based**: A credit-based system that let's you pay as you go.&#x20;
* **Subscription plans**: Charged monthly. Receive a specified top-up so you can keep building.&#x20;

#### Free credits for new users

When you sign up, you automatically receive $5 in free credits.\
Use them to test, build, and run automations with zero commitment.

#### Custom - Enterprise

For more extensive automation usage.&#x20;

Email **support@agemo.ai** for pricing options, dedicated support, and custom arrangements.

### What credits are and how they work

Every action, whether building with Cody or running a workflow, consumes a small amount of credits. This is based on the computational resources and integrations involved.

#### Credits are used when you:

* Build automations through chat with Cody
* Edit existing workflows
* Run workflows (manual, scheduled, or triggered)
* Use AI, external APIs, or web automation

After you've first run a workflow, you'll be able to see its estimated cost per run from the run page.&#x20;

There are no idle fees, nor background charges.&#x20;

We're constantly working on making our pricing more transparent.

You can check your real-time balance anytime in the bottom-left of your screen, or by clicking `Account` and heading to your [Wallet](https://codewords.agemo.ai/account/wallet).
