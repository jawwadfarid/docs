# Concepts





* **Create**. Users can build complex back-end systems in minutes from a prompt. These are called “CodeWords functions”.&#x20;
* **Manage**. Everything you create on CodeWords lives in your own library under “My Functions”.
* **Compose**. The real power of CodeWords comes from the ability to compose multiple functions with each other to build more complex software. Like assembling LEGO blocks.
* **Run.** Every function is automatically deployed on the cloud in one-click, allowing users to use the created software directly.
* **API.** Functions are made available via the Run page and can be integrated anywhere.&#x20;
