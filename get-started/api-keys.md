# API Keys

Sometimes the chat agent can make mistakes and ask you to provide API keys (for LLM models). In this case, ask the chat agent to use their own.\
You won't have to provide an API key unless the agent says that they don't have an API key for a particular app that you are trying to use, or if you want to use your API key!
