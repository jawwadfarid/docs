# Viewing the code

If you're in the **same chat** where the workflow was created, simply ask Cody to display the code directly.

{% hint style="info" %}
"Show me the full code."
{% endhint %}

If you're in a **new chat session**, you'll need to reference the specific workflow URL.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
"Could you show me the code for the '\[Input the workflow URL]' ?"
{% endhint %}

This approach ensures you can access your workflow code regardless of which chat session you're currently using.
