# Viewing the code

If you're in the **same chat** where the workflow was created, simply ask the chat agent to display the workflow code directly.

If you're in a **new chat session**, you'll need to reference the specific workflow by name. For example, ask: "Could you show me the code for the '\[Input the workflow URL]' workflow?"

This approach ensures you can access your workflow code regardless of which chat session you're currently using.
