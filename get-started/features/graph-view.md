# Graph view

The Graph view provides a complete visual map of your workflow. For complex processes with multiple branches and conditional steps, the Graph view helps you understand the flow of data at a glance. You can see how applications connect, where decisions are made, and the path your data takes from trigger to final action.

To access it, simply click the Graph view tab in the workflow editor.
