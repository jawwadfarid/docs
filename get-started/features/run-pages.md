# Run Pages

A Run page is a detailed log of a single execution of one of your workflows. Whenever a workflow is triggered, a new Run page is generated, giving you a complete audit trail of the process.

Each Run page shows you:

* The status of the run (e.g., Success, Failed, In Progress).
* The exact time each step was executed.
* The data that was received and sent at every stage.
* Detailed error messages if something went wrong.

If an automation fails, the Run page is the first place you should look to diagnose the problem.
