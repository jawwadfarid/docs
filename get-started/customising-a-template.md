# Customising a template

You can customise any existing workflow template by clicking the 'edit' button, or you can click into Cody. The customised option on a workflow template or on a workflow that's yours allows you to change that automation to your vision. Just describe how you want to customise it!

This is a great way to explore the capabilities that you want to build.

**Note that customising a workflow creates a new workflow with changes instead of changing the existing one.**
