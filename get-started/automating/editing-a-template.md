# Editing a Template

### Overview

This guide shows you how to take existing CodeWords templates and customize them for your specific needs. Think of templates as proven automation blueprints that you can modify, enhance, and make your own.

Whether you're adding new features, changing what information users provide, or customizing what your automation delivers, this guide walks you through the process step-by-step.

### What does template editing do? Why is it important?

Template editing lets you start with automations that already work and adapt them to your exact requirements. Instead of building from scratch, you're taking something tested and reliable, then making it better for your situation.

**Why this matters:**

* **Save significant time** — Start with working automations instead of a blank slate
* **Learn proven patterns** — See how experienced builders structure their automations
* **Reduce risk** — Build on tested foundations rather than starting from zero
* **Get results faster** — Focus on your unique requirements, not basic setup

You'll use template editing when you find an automation that's about 70% of what you need and think, "this is close, but I need it to do X differently."

### Step-by-step guide to editing templates

#### Find your starting template

Browse the available templates and look for one that aligns with your goals. You're not looking for a perfect match — you're looking for potential.

**What to look for:**

* Similar types of data inputs (the information you have)
* Similar workflow approach (how it processes things)
* Similar end objectives (what you want to achieve)

Don't stress about finding an exact match. If you can see the foundation of what you need, that's perfect.
