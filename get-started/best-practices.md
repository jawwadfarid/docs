# Best Practices

Clear inputs form great automations. Use natural language to explain the automation that you want to build. If you can be more specific early on in the chat, the better.

You can either build the workflow in iterations or request the entire workflow to be built.

The agent will break down the building process and ensure the entire automation is built with proper testing done!

When prompting on CodeWords to build a workflow, it's usually better to prompt in a way that explains it step by step.

{% hint style="info" %}
_"Create a workflow that will send an email from my personal Gmail to the respondents of the Google Form that I created. Send them a personalised email thanking them for their feedback. The Google Form asks them to fill in their name and email address."_
{% endhint %}
