# Integrations

### &#x20;What This Guide Covers

This guide will help you understand how to connect CodeWords with thousands of different apps and services - no coding required! Whether you want to automate email workflows, sync data between tools, or build powerful business processes, CodeWords makes it easy.

***

### Quick Start: What Are Integrations?

Think of integrations as bridges between different apps and services. Instead of manually copying data from Gmail to Google Sheets, or posting updates from Slack to Notion, integrations let your apps "talk" to each other automatically.

Real-world example: When you receive an important email in Gmail, an integration can automatically:

* Extract the key information
* Create a task in Asana
* Post a notification in your team's Slack channel
* Add the details to a Google Sheet
