# Intro

Hereâ€™s everything you need to know about how to build and use workflows. Welcome to this step-by-step guide on how to create a workflow automation.

#### What is CodeWords?

CodeWords lets you build AI-powered workflows that run automatically. Connect your favorite apps, add some AI magic, and watch your repetitive tasks handle themselves.

**What is a workflow?**\
\
A workflow is basically a series of steps that happen automatically to complete a task.

Think of it like a recipe, but for getting work done:

**Real-world example:** When you get a new email with an attachment:

1. Save the attachment to Google Drive
2. Send a Slack message to your team about the new file
3. Add a reminder to your calendar to review it
4. Update a spreadsheet with the file details

Instead of doing these 4 steps manually every time, a workflow does them all automatically when that email arrives.\
\
Workflows save you time by handling repetitive tasks so you can focus on more important work. With  CodeWords, you can set these up without needing to code anything yourself.
