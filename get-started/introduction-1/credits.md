# Credits

Credits are the currency of CodeWords. They give you a simple, transparent way to manage your usage.

* What is a credit? Every action or step within a running workflow consumes a set number of credits. Simple actions, like updating a spreadsheet cell, use fewer credits than complex actions, like using an AI model to summarize text.
* How are credits used? Credits are deducted from your account balance automatically each time one of your workflows runs. You can monitor your credit consumption on your main Dashboard or in the Settings > Billing section.
* How to add more credits Running low? Topping up is easy.
  1. Go to Settings > Wallet.
  2. Click Add Top Up Wallet.
  3. Choose the credit package that works best for you and complete the purchase. Your new credits will be added to your account instantly.
