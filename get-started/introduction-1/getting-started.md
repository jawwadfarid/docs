# Getting started

### Getting started

You can create powerful processes in just a few minutes. Here are two ways to get your first automation up and running.

#### Run your first automation (from a template)

Templates are the fastest way to get started. They are pre-built solutions for popular use cases.

1. Navigate to the Templates tab in the left sidebar.
2. Browse or search for a template that fits your needs (e.g., "Save Gmail attachments to Dropbox").
3. Click on the template and select Use Template.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to connect your apps (e.g., grant access to Gmail and Dropbox).
5. Activate the workflow. That's it! Your automation is now live.

#### Build your first automation (from scratch)

For custom needs, building from scratch with Cody is simple and intuitive.

1. Go to the Chat Interface.
2.  In the message box, describe the process you want to automate. Be as clear and specific as you can. For example:

    > “When a new row is added to my Google Sheet named ‘New Leads’, take the email from column B and the name from column A and send a personalized welcome email using my Gmail account.”
3. Cody will ask clarifying questions and show you the steps it plans to take.
4. Once you confirm, Cody will guide you through connecting the necessary apps (Google Sheets and Gmail in this case).
5. You can test the workflow to make sure it runs correctly.
6. Click Deploy to set your new custom workflow live.
