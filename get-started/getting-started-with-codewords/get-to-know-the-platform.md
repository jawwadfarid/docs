# Get to know the platform

When you first sign in to CodeWords, you'll land on your main dashboard. Here’s a quick tour of the key areas to help you get familiar with the layout.

* **The Dashboard**: This is your home base. It gives you a high-level overview of your active workflows, recent activity, templates and Cody.
* **The Chat Interface**: This is where you’ll interact with Cody, our AI automation assistant. Simply describe the workflow you want to build, and Cody will get started.
* **My Workflows**: This is a list of all the workflows you have built. From here, you can edit, activate, deactivate, or check the run history of any workflow.
* **Templates**: A library of pre-built, ready-to-use automations for common tasks like social media posting, lead management, and data entry.
