# Introduction

Here’s everything you need to know about how to build on CodeWords. Welcome to this step-by-step guide on how to create a workflow automation.

#### What is CodeWords?

CodeWords lets you build AI-powered workflows that run automatically. Connect your favorite apps, add some AI magic, and watch your repetitive tasks handle themselves helping you build production-grade, multi-step automations from a chat.&#x20;

**What is a workflow?**\
\
A workflow is basically a series of steps that happen automatically to complete a task.

Think of it like a recipe, but for getting work done:

**Real-world example:** When you get a new email with an attachment:

1. Save the attachment to Google Drive
2. Send a Slack message to your team about the new file
3. Add a reminder to your calendar to review it
4. Update a spreadsheet with the file details

Instead of doing these 4 steps manually every time, a workflow does them all automatically when that email arrives.\
\
Workflows save you time by handling repetitive tasks so you can focus on more important work. With  CodeWords, you can set these up without needing to code anything yourself.

For a non-technical user, replace manual tasks with a collection of AI workflows in a single platform. Not exactly what you need? You can build a new automation from a chat. **Think Zapier meets ChatGPT with no limits.**

For a technical builder, you can build, iterate, and deploy workflows and automations without the boilerplate, all within a few minutes without having to worry about infrastructure. **Think Cursor for workflow automation.**"
