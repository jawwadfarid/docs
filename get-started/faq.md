# FAQ

### General Questions

<details>

<summary>What is CodeWords?</summary>

[CodeWords](https://codewords.agemo.ai/) is an AI-powered automation platform that helps teams and individuals build, deploy, and manage workflows faster. Whether you’re a no-code creator or a developer, CodeWords turns plain English instructions into fully functional Python-based automations and intelligent agents.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How does CodeWords work?</summary>

CodeWords conversational AI assistant (Cody) generates real code behind the scenes. You describe what you want, and CodeWords builds it, integrates your tools, and runs it automatically.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Do I need coding knowledge to use CodeWords?</summary>

No. CodeWords is built with non-technical users in mind.\
It’s designed so anyone can create AI agents and workflow automations just by describing what they want in plain English — no coding required.\
Developers can still access and edit the Python code for deeper customization when needed.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How quickly can I build my first workflow?</summary>

Most users can build and deploy their first workflow in under five minutes using Cody’s step-by-step conversational builder and pre-made templates.

<summary>What can I build with CodeWords?</summary>

CodeWords helps you build smart automations and AI agents that work with 2,700+ popular tools like LinkedIn, Google Workspace, WhatsApp, Slack, Telegram, and GitHub. You can automate anything — from simple data tasks to complex, AI-powered workflows or AI Agents that run your business in the background.

Each automation you create automatically includes a Run Page, where you can run it manually, schedule it, or trigger it based on app events. It also comes with an API endpoint, so you can interact with your automation through an external service with your codewords API key — all with no extra setup or coding required.
