[CodeWords](https://codewords.agemo.ai/) is an AI-powered automation platform that helps teams and individuals build, deploy, and manage workflows faster. Whether you’re a no-code creator or a developer, CodeWords turns plain English instructions into fully functional Python-based automations and intelligent agents.
