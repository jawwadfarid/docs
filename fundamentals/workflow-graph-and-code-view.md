# Workflow Graph and Code View

### **Overview**

Every automation you build in CodeWords has two perspectives:

* **The Graph View** – a visual map of how your workflow operates.
* **The Code View** – a detailed look at the technical configuration behind it.

Together, they give you complete visibility into what your workflow does and how it works — whether you’re a non-technical creator or an experienced developer.

### **1. The Workflow Graph**

#### **What Is the Workflow Graph?**

The **Workflow Graph** visually represents how your automation runs, similar to a flowchart.\
It shows:

* Where your workflow begins (manually, on a schedule, or through triggers)
* The sequence of steps it performs
* The external tools and services involved
* How data moves from one step to another

Each element is called a **node** and represents a step, and arrows show how data flows between them.

#### **Why the Graph View Matters**

**For Non-Technical Users**

* **See the big picture:** Understand your workflow at a glance without reading code
* **Track progress:** Watch the workflow being built step-by-step
* **Communicate clearly:** Share the automation’s structure with teammates
* **Spot issues early:** Detect missteps before final deployment

#### **What You’ll See**

1. **Starting Points**
   * Run Manually — You start it when ready
   * Run on Schedule — Executes automatically (e.g., every day at 9 AM)
   * Run on Trigger — Fires when an event occurs (e.g., new email, form submission)
2. **Steps and Actions**
   * Data processing, API calls, or AI-based analysis
   * Integrations such as Gmail, Slack, LinkedIn, or Google Sheets
3. **Decision Points**
   * Conditional branches, e.g.\
     If order > $1000 → notify finance team
4. **Integrations**
   * Visual icons indicate tools in use (Slack, Gmail, Notion, Stripe, etc.)

### **Accessing the Graph View**

When Cody (your CodeWords assistant) builds a workflow, the graph updates automatically during each phase:

* **Planning:** Cody drafts the initial workflow outline
* **Building:** Completed and active steps update live
* **After Deployment:** The final graph serves as your permanent visual reference

**To open it:** Select **Graph View** in the workflow editor.

### **2. The Code View**

#### **What Is the Code View?**

The **Code View** displays the Python code that defines your workflow’s behavior.\
It’s a text-based configuration showing every step, parameter, and integration — perfect for users who want technical insight or advanced control.

#### **Why It’s Useful**

* **Transparency:** See the exact logic behind each step
* **Debugging:** Identify issues by reviewing the underlying script
* **Customization:** Fine-tune details not visible in the UI
* **Documentation:** Keep an accurate version of your automation logic

**To open it:** Click **Code View** in the workflow editor.

#### **Viewing the Code**

You can access the code in two ways:

**1. During Development**\
Ask Cody:

* “Show me the code for the LinkedIn search step.”
* “Can I review the workflow code before deployment?”\
  Cody displays annotated code with line numbers, explanations, and highlights.

**2. After Deployment**\
Ask Cody to view or compare versions of a deployed workflow.

#### **Code Structure Overview**

Typical sections include:

* **Header:** Required integrations or dependencies
* **Inputs:** Variables or data sources used
* **Main Logic:** Step-by-step workflow logic
* **Outputs:** Results or returned data
* **Comments:** Human-readable explanations

### **3. Putting It All Together**

| View Type      | Purpose                                      | Best For                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Graph View** | Visualize _what_ happens and _in what order_ | Non-technical users, reviewers  |
| **Code View**  | Understand _how_ each step works in detail   | Developers, technical debugging |

You can build, run, and monitor automations entirely through the visual graph — or dive into code for deeper insight.

### **4. FAQs**

**Do I need to understand code to use CodeWords?**\
No. The Graph View exists so anyone can build and understand workflows visually.

**When should I use Graph View?**\
During planning, reviewing builds, or troubleshooting unexpected results.

**When should I use Code View?**\
When debugging, exporting, or learning how your automation works internally.

**Can I modify the code?**\
Yes — but you can also simply _describe the change_ in plain English. Cody will update both the graph and code automatically.

### **Getting Help**

Need clarity or want to inspect your workflow?

* Ask: “Show me my workflow graph.”
* Ask: “Display the code for this workflow.”
* Or say: “Explain what happens in the ‘Extract Data’ step.”

Cody provides both a visual overview and a technical breakdown — ensuring you have full transparency without ever needing to code.
