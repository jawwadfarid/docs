# Triggers

### **Overview**

Triggers let your workflows start automatically when something happens—like receiving an email, a Slack message, or an update in a connected app.\
Scheduling, on the other hand, runs workflows at fixed intervals—hourly, daily, or at custom times.

Think of them as two core automation types:

* **Event-driven triggers:** React instantly to external events.
* **Scheduled triggers:** Run tasks at predefined times.

Together, they make CodeWords workflows autonomous and reliable.

### Event-driven triggers

Event-driven triggers allow your automations to respond immediately when key events occur—such as a message being sent, a form submitted, or a new record created.

#### **Native CodeWords Triggers**

These work seamlessly out of the box with minimal setup:

* **Slack:** New messages, reactions, or when a user joins a channel
* **WhatsApp:** Incoming messages sent to the CodeWords WhatsApp number, group messages where CodeWords is a member, and message reactions.

To activate, simply connect your accounts from the [Integrations](https://codewords.agemo.ai/account/integrations/) page. Once connected, these triggers are instantly available.

#### **Pipedream Platform Triggers**

CodeWords integrates with the Pipedream platform, giving you access to **over 2,700 apps and services** for event-based automation.\
Popular options include:

* **Gmail:** New emails, label changes, or draft creation
* **Google Calendar:** Event creation, updates, or deletions
* **GitHub:** Code pushes, new issues, pull requests
* **Notion:** Page or database updates
* **Discord, HubSpot, Stripe, Airtable**, and many more

If your app supports event-based actions, CodeWords can likely trigger from it.

#### **Custom Webhooks**

If your system isn’t natively supported, CodeWords provides custom webhook URLs to handle external events.\
These URLs can be called from any platform capable of sending HTTP POST requests with JSON data.

To create one, simply tell Cody which external system you want to connect. Cody will automatically generate and configure the webhook endpoint for you.

To learn more about Webhooks in CodeWords, visit the [Webhooks](https://docs.codewords.ai/fundamentals/webhooks) documentation page.

### **Setting Up Event Triggers**

Follow these steps to enable event-based automations:

1. **Connect accounts** — Go to the [Integrations](https://codewords.agemo.ai/account/integrations) page and link the app you want to use as a trigger source.
2. **Define the event** — Tell Cody to trigger your workflow based on a specific event (e.g., “New message in Slack”).
3. **Confirm setup** — Once configured, your event trigger will appear on the [Triggers](https://codewords.agemo.ai/workflows/triggers) page, ready for use.

Event-driven triggers allow workflows to run instantly when external systems send data.

### **Scheduled Triggers**

Scheduled triggers let you run workflows automatically at set intervals—ideal for reports, reminders, or maintenance tasks.

#### **Setting Up a Schedule**

1. **Test your workflow** — From the [My Workflows](https://codewords.agemo.ai/workflows/library) page, make sure your workflow runs successfully.
2. **Create a schedule** — Select the Schedule option and choose when the workflow should run.
3. **Select frequency** — Set it to run hourly, daily, weekly, or at a custom interval.
4. **Save your schedule** — The workflow will now execute automatically based on your chosen timing.
5. **Manage schedules** — Visit the [Schedules](https://codewords.agemo.ai/workflows/schedule) page to view or modify all active scheduled workflows.

### **When to Use Each**

| Use Case                                   | Best Option            |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Reacting instantly to new data or messages | Event-driven trigger   |
| Running recurring reports or reminders     | Scheduled trigger      |
| Connecting unsupported systems             | Custom webhook trigger |

Event-driven triggers are best for responsive workflows. Scheduled triggers are ideal for predictable, time-based automation.

### **Summary**

Triggers make your automations proactive and reliable.

* **Event-driven triggers** react to real-time events.
* **Scheduled triggers** run at specific times.
* **Custom webhooks** extend integration to any system.\
  Whether you’re managing messages, syncing data, or scheduling reports, CodeWords handles it automatically—no manual input or coding required.
