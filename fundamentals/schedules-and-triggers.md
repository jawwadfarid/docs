# Schedules & Triggers

Triggers kick off your automations instantly when something happens, like getting an email or a Slack message. Scheduling runs your workflows on autopilot — every hour, daily, or whenever you need them.

Think of triggers as your automation's ears (always listening for events) and scheduling as its internal clock (running tasks right on time).

## Event-driven triggers

Triggers allow your automations to become reactive, jumping into action the moment something important occurs.

#### Native CodeWords triggers

These work right out of the box with minimal fuss:

* Slack — New messages, reactions, and when someone joins a channel
* WhatsApp Business — Incoming messages and status updates

Just connect your accounts at  [Integrations page](https://codewords.agemo.ai/account/integrations/) and you're ready to go.

#### Pipedream platform triggers

Here's where things get exciting — access to 2,700+ platforms, including:

* Gmail — New emails, label changes, draft creation
* Google Calendar — Events created, updated, or deleted
* GitHub — Code pushes, new issues, pull requests
* Notion — Page updates, database changes
* Discord, HubSpot, Stripe, Airtable — The list goes on and on

Basically, if there's a platform you use for work, there's probably a trigger for it.

#### Custom webhooks

Need to connect something that doesn't have a pre-built trigger? No problem. CodeWords gives you custom webhook URLs that you can plug into any system that can send HTTP requests. You can ask Cody to set this up for you.

## **Setting up event-triggers**

1. Connect your accounts from the [Integrations page](https://codewords.agemo.ai/account/integrations/) for the particular app that you want to activate the workflow for.
2. Specify to Cody to trigger the workflow based on an event trigger, and Cody will set up the necessary trigger for you
3. If it's an event-driven trigger on an app event, you can find the trigger once set up from your [triggers page](https://codewords.agemo.ai/workflows/triggers)

## **Setting up schedules**

1. Run your workflow first — Head to the workflow from my workflows and make sure it works perfectly
2. Create a new schedule — Click the schedule button and choose your timing
3. Pick your frequency — Use simple options like  "daily" at a particular time.
4. Save and you're done — Your workflow will now run automatically
5. Go to the schedules page — Visit [Schedules](https://codewords.agemo.ai/workflows/schedule) to see all your scheduled automations
