# Using a Template

### What are templates?

Templates are pre-built automations that solve common business problems. Instead of starting from scratch, you can use a template that's already been tested and proven to work, then customize it for your specific needs.

Think of templates as professional automation services that are available instantly. Just provide your inputs and get results.

### What do templates do? Why are they important?

Templates give you instant access to powerful automations without any technical work. You'll get professional workflow solutions that would typically require hours of development or expensive custom tools.

You'll solve business problems faster: Instead of manually researching prospects, monitoring competitors, or processing data, you'll have automations that do it for you with consistent, high-quality results.

### Step-by-step guide to using templates

#### Discover what's available

Browse the [template library](https://codewords.agemo.ai/template-gallery) to see what problems you can solve immediately. You'll find automations for lead research, content analysis, data enrichment, communication assistance, and monitoring services, and more.

Each template clearly explains what it does, what you'll need to provide, and what results you can expect.

To learn more about templates on CodeWords, you can check the [template docs](https://docs.codewords.ai/templates/).

#### Pick your first template

Choose one that addresses a current business need you're facing. Don't overthink it â€” templates work best when you try them with real scenarios from your actual work.
