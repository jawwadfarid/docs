# Introduction to Cody

### What is Cody?

**Cody is your AI automation assistant** that builds powerful **workflows and AI agents through natural conversation**. Unlike traditional workflow builders that rely on drag-and-drop blocks, **Cody generates real automation code**, adapts intelligently to your needs, and handles **complex, multi-step logic** that other tools can’t.

***

### How it works

#### 1. Understands your needs

Simply describe what you want to achieve in **natural language** — Cody analyzes your goal, determines the required **steps, logic, and app integrations**, and presents a clear plan. You can **review, edit, or approve** this plan before Cody begins building.

#### 2. Builds the workflow

Once approved, Cody **writes the automation code** and connects all the necessary integrations to power your **workflow automation** or **AI agents**. It handles the technical details behind the scenes, ensuring your workflow is efficient, reliable, and production-ready without you having to write a single line of code.

#### 3. Asks clarifying questions

At any stage of the process, if something isn’t clear, **Cody proactively asks follow-up questions** to ensure it fully understands your goal. This helps refine your workflow and guarantees that the final automation behaves exactly as you intend.

#### 4. Deploys and tests automatically

Once approved, **Cody deploys your automation and runs real-data tests** to verify that every step performs as expected. It validates integrations, logic, and outputs to ensure everything functions smoothly. If any issues arise during testing, **Cody automatically reviews the workflow logs, identifies the root cause, and applies fixes** — keeping your automation running reliably without manual debugging.

***

### What You Can Do

Cody empowers you to **create, modify, and manage automations and AI agents** using natural conversation — no coding required.

* **Build new workflows:**\
  Turn your ideas into fully functional **AI-powered automations**. Just describe what you want — from lead tracking to content generation — and Cody builds it end-to-end.
* **Modify existing workflows:**\
  Instantly update, extend, or optimize your workflows. Add new steps, connect different apps, or refine automation logic without touching any code.
* **Debug and optimize:**\
  When something doesn’t work as expected, Cody automatically inspects logs, identifies issues, and helps you **fix or optimize** the workflow for better performance.
* **Connect with other platforms:**\
  Integrate seamlessly with external apps or custom apps built on **Lovable**, **Bolt**, **V0**, and many more.

### Why Cody Is Different

#### Conversational Automation

Unlike traditional workflow builders that rely on drag-and-drop interfaces or complex form setups, **Cody lets you build through natural conversation**. Simply describe your goal in plain English, and Cody translates it into a working automation — instantly.

#### Real Code, No Coding

While most automation tools depend on predefined actions, **Cody generates real Python automation code behind the scenes**. This means it can handle **complex logic, multi-step workflows, and deep API integrations** that rigid no-code builders can’t.

With Cody, you get the **flexibility of coding** and the **ease of conversation** — an intelligent agent that thinks, builds, and adapts like a developer, without requiring one.
