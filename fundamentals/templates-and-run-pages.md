# Templates and run pages

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOoiylD6TQM" %}

### What are automation templates and run pages?

**Templates** are packaged and ready-to-use automations. They allow you to start automating your workflows without needing to build anything from scratch.&#x20;

**Run pages** are how you can use and access a template in order to run that automation. They contain a selection of preset input fields so you can enter your data, run automations instantly, and receive a preset output.&#x20;

Each template is tested, optimized, and ready to use, so you can focus on your goals instead of setup. Templates give you immediate access to powerful, no-code workflows that replace hours of manual or technical work.&#x20;

They help you:

* Automate research, outreach, monitoring, and analysis.
* Get consistent, high-quality results every time.
* Save time and eliminate repetitive tasks.

Whether you’re tracking competitors, enriching leads, summarizing content, or processing reports — templates do the heavy lifting for you.

### Where can I find templates?

There are two main places you'll have access to templates:

* [**Template Gallery**](https://codewords.agemo.ai/template-gallery): A collection of pre-built automation templates from the CodeWords community.&#x20;
* [**My Workflows**](https://codewords.agemo.ai/workflows/library): Where you'll find all the automations that you've built with CodeWords. After Cody has finished building your automation in the chat, you'll be given a URL that takes you straight to your template's run page. You'll be able to return to those templates in the My Workflows section.&#x20;

You can find specific automation templates for your use case by using the search bar or picking a preset category tag, for example WhatsApp, Productivity, or Sales.&#x20;

Templates in both locations allow you to do the following:

* **Access the run page**: Click to head straight to the template's run page. From here you can run that automation manually.&#x20;
* **Click to Remix**: Click `Remix` to edit or update the template.&#x20;
* **Schedule**: Click the template and select `Schedule` to automatically run the automation at set times.&#x20;
* **Share**: Click the template and select `Share` to share this workflow template with friends, teammates, or to social media.&#x20;

### How to use templates and run pages

#### 1. Explore available templates

Browse the [**Template Gallery**](https://codewords.agemo.ai/template-gallery) to see pre-built automations for and range of use cases.

For example:&#x20;

* Lead research and enrichment
* Competitor and content monitoring
* Communication and marketing workflows
* Data organization and analysis

Each template includes clear setup instructions, inputs required, and sample results.

#### 2. Choose your template

Pick a template that fits a real use case in your workflow.&#x20;

Testing with actual data helps you learn faster and see value immediately.

#### 3. Run the template

Running a template is simple:

1. Click a template.
2. Connect to any required integrations by selecting the integrations dropdown.
3. Fill in your input data according to the required fields.&#x20;
4. Click `Run` . You'll be able to see the estimated cost and time it takes to run this automation from the run button.&#x20;

Your automation will run and deliver your output.

#### 4. Edit a template

If you want to edit a template to better-align with your use case and tech stack, click `Edit` and describe what you'd like to happen.&#x20;

For example, these are some edits you might wish to make:&#x20;

* "Change the output format to a PDF report"
* "Add trend analysis to this workflow"&#x20;
* "Use Telegram instead of WhatsApp"&#x20;

Cody updates the automation automatically, so you can customize without needing to update any code.
