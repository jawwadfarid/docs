# Editing a Template

### Overview

This guide shows you how to take existing CodeWords templates and customize them for your specific needs. Think of templates as proven automation blueprints that you can modify, enhance, and make your own.

Whether you're adding new features, changing what information users provide, or customizing what your automation delivers, this guide walks you through the process step-by-step.

### What does template editing do? Why is it important?

Template editing lets you start with automations that already work and adapt them to your exact requirements. Instead of building from scratch, you're taking something tested and reliable, then making it better for your situation.

**Why this matters:**

* **Save significant time** — Start with working automations instead of a blank slate
* **Learn proven patterns** — See how experienced builders structure their automations
* **Reduce risk** — Build on tested foundations rather than starting from zero
* **Get results faster** — Focus on your unique requirements, not basic setup

You'll use template editing when you find an automation that's about 70% of what you need and think, "this is close, but I need it to do X differently."

### Step-by-step guide to editing templates

#### Find your starting template

Browse the available templates and look for one that aligns with your goals. You're not looking for a perfect match — you're looking for potential.

**What to look for:**

* Similar types of data inputs (the information you have)
* Similar workflow approach (how it processes things)
* Similar end objectives (what you want to achieve)

Don't stress about finding an exact match. If you can see the foundation of what you need, that's perfect.

#### Understand the template structure

Once you find a promising template, familiarize yourself with how it works:

* **Input requirements** — What information does it need from users?
* **Processing workflow** — What steps does it take to complete its task?
* **External connections** — What services does it connect to?
* **Output format** — What does it deliver to users?

This isn't about memorizing every detail. You're just getting oriented with what you're working with.

#### Plan your customizations

Create a clear list of what you want to modify:

* "I need it to also analyze competitor websites"
* "Users should be able to specify their target market"
* "I want the final output as a formatted report instead of plain text"

Keep your goals specific and concrete. Vague objectives lead to unfocused editing sessions.

#### Start your editing session

Begin by creating your custom version of the template. You'll specify which template you're starting from and what you want to call your customized version.

**Important principle:** Once you start editing, you'll continue working on the same automation file. Think of it like editing the same document — you keep refining the same project rather than creating new ones each time.

#### Make incremental changes

This is the core of template editing. Make one focused change at a time, test it, then move to the next modification.

**Common types of changes:**

* **Adding new input fields** — When you need users to provide additional information
* **Integrating new services** — When you want to connect to additional platforms or tools
* **Modifying the workflow** — When you need to change how the automation processes information
* **Customizing outputs** — When you want to change what users receive

Each change builds on the previous one, creating your perfectly tailored automation step by step.

#### Validate your changes

After each significant modification, the system checks your work to ensure everything is properly structured and will function correctly.

This validation is like having an expert review your work before you launch it. If something needs adjustment, you'll get clear feedback about what to fix.

#### Deploy and test with real scenarios

Once your customizations pass validation, you'll deploy your automation and test it with actual data that represents how it will be used.

This testing phase ensures your modifications work correctly in real-world situations, not just in theory.

### Troubleshooting template editing

#### When something isn't working

**Step 1:** Review the feedback you receive. You don't need to understand every technical detail — focus on the main message.

**Step 2:** Trust your instincts about what might need attention:

* Did you forget to include a new service connection?
* Is there an inconsistency in how you've named things?
* Are you missing a required piece of information?

**Step 3:** Make the logical adjustment and test again.

#### When results feel off

Pay attention to your intuition. If something feels wrong, investigate:

* Outputs that seem incomplete or inaccurate
* Processing that takes unexpectedly long
* Results that don't match what you expected

Your instincts about quality are usually right.

#### When you're stuck

If you hit a roadblock:

* **Step back** — Review what you've accomplished so far
* **Test incrementally** — Try running simpler versions to isolate issues
* **Add visibility** — Include progress indicators to see what's happening
* **Return to stability** — Go back to your last working version and try a different approach

There's no shame in taking a step back and trying a different path forward.

#### Getting help

If you're stuck, visit the [CodeWords Discord](https://discord.codewords.ai) or use the help chat. Reference your editing session and describe what you're trying to accomplish.

### Best practices and tips

#### Make focused changes

One modification at a time. If something feels too complex, break it into smaller, manageable pieces.

#### Trust your judgment

Templates already follow solid patterns. You're enhancing them with your specific needs. If an approach feels right, it probably is.

#### Customize thoughtfully

Make the automation yours:

* Clear descriptions that match how you communicate
* Input examples that make sense for your users
* Output formats that work best for your audience

#### Consider your users

When customizing, think about who will use this automation:

* What information do they have readily available?
* What format of results would be most useful to them?
* How do they prefer to interact with tools?

#### Embrace the iterative process

The strength of template editing is starting with something proven. Your changes might work perfectly, need small adjustments, or require a different approach. All of these outcomes help you build exactly what you need.

#### Test thoroughly

Always test your customized automation with realistic scenarios. What works in theory needs to work with your actual data and use cases.

### Summary

Template editing transforms existing automations into perfectly tailored solutions for your needs. You start with proven foundations, make focused improvements, and create exactly what your situation requires.

The process flows from finding a suitable starting template, understanding its structure, planning your changes, making incremental modifications, and testing thoroughly with real scenarios.
