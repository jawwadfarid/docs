# Intorduction to Cody

## Welcome to Cody

Cody is your dedicated AI automation assistant that powers CodeWords, allowing you to build, validate, and deploy your automations by simply describing what you need in natural language.

How does it work? Cody understands your instructions. When you describe a workflow, Cody translates your words into a structured workflow, identifies the required steps and integrations, and creates a plan. It will ask clarifying questions to resolve ambiguity and ensure the final automation matches your intent perfectly.

How can you use it? You can chat with Cody to:

* Build new workflows from a simple idea.
* Modify existing automations by asking for changes or additions.
* Debug issues by describing a problem and asking for a fix.
* Explore ideas on what you can automate in your business.

Getting the most out of Cody Clear prompts lead to better results. Here are a few quick tips:

* Be specific: Instead of “Watch my email,” try “When I receive an email in Gmail with ‘Invoice’ in the subject, save the attachment to my ‘Invoices 2025’ folder in Google Drive.”
* Provide context: Mention the names of specific files, folders, or projects.
* Iterate: Start with a simple version of your idea and add complexity later.
