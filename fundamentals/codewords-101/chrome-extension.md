# Chrome Extension

### Introduction

The CodeWords Chrome extension automates tasks on websites where you're already logged in. It runs directly in your browser, using your existing sessions to access private content like LinkedIn feeds, dashboards, and member-only pages.

### When to use the Chrome extension

Perfect for:

* Getting content from private pages (LinkedIn feeds, dashboards)
* Simple website tasks like clicking buttons or filling forms
* When reliability is more important than speed

Not ideal for:

* Scheduled automations when you're away
* When you need to use your browser simultaneously
* When speed is critical

### Getting started

1. Install: [Chrome Web Store link](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/codewords/fgcbeegcaikofigbnfmmlgcimdkmfnce)
2. Log in: Sign in to websites you want to automate
