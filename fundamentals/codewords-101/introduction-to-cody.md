# Introduction to Cody

### Welcome to Cody

Cody is your AI automation assistant that builds powerful workflows through simple conversation. The difference? Cody doesn't just connect apps â€” it creates real automation code. Cody thinks, adapts, and handles complex scenarios that traditional workflow tools can't touch.

### How it works

**Understands your needs:** You describe what you want to accomplish, and Cody figures out the steps and integrations needed.

**Builds the workflow:** Cody creates the automation, handles the technical details, and makes sure everything works together.

**Asks clarifying questions:** If anything's unclear, Cody will ask follow-up questions to get it right.

**Deploys and tests:** Your automation goes live and gets tested with real data to make sure it works perfectly.

### What you can do

**Build new workflows:** Turn ideas into working automations

**Modify existing ones:** Change or add features to current workflows

**Debug issues:** Fix problems when things aren't working, or you can let

**Call workflows using other apps:** Connect your workflows with other apps that are built on lovable, bolt, etc

### How is Cody different?

**Conversational automation:** Most workflow tools make you drag boxes around or fill out forms. With CodeWords, you just have a conversation with Cody. Describe what you want in plain English, and it gets built.

**Real code, no coding:** Other tools limit you to pre-built actions and simple logic. CodeWords generates actual Python code behind the scenes, so it can handle complex scenarios, custom logic, and integrations that rigid workflow builders can't touch.
