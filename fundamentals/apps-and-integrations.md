# Apps and Integrations

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Y0bqu9I3c" %}

### Overview

CodeWords integrates with over 2,800 apps and integrations.&#x20;

You can browse most of our integrations through our [integrations page](https://codewords.agemo.ai/account/integrations), and you can also connect to external tools using an API key.&#x20;

### Connecting to integrations directly

Any integration listed directly in the integrations page can be connected in a couple of clicks.&#x20;

You can do this in a few ways, for example:&#x20;

* Search and connect directly to an integration via our [integrations page](https://codewords.agemo.ai/account/integrations).&#x20;
* Connect whilst you're building an automation by clicking on the integration's graph node and clicking `Connect` .&#x20;
* From a run page, select the integrations dropdown and click `Connect` to the necessary integrations.&#x20;

Simply follow the instructions to connect and integrate without needing any technical configuration.&#x20;

Whenever an integration is required, you'll be prompted to connect to it. After you've connected once, you won't need to do this step again.&#x20;

If you can't find what you're looking for, simply ask Cody if CodeWords has access to a specific integration. You can also learn how to use [external API integrations here](https://docs.codewords.ai/~/revisions/AnCxc4sCFTxbzqmH5Cb6/fundamentals/apps-and-integrations/external-api-integration).&#x20;
