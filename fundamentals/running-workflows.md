# Running Workflows

You can test your workflow directly in the same chat where you created it by switching to Run mode, making it easy to validate your workflow's functionality.

You can also use the Run page, which is a detailed log of a single execution of one of your workflows. Whenever a workflow is triggered, a new Run page is generated, giving you a complete audit trail of the process.

Each Run page shows you:

* The status of the run (e.g., Success, Failed, In Progress).
* The exact time each step was executed.
* The data that was received and sent at every stage.
* Detailed error messages if something went wrong.

If an automation fails, the Run page is the first place you should look to diagnose the problem.
