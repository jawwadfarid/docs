# Accounts and Billing

### Understanding credits

**What's a credit?** Think of credits as your automation fuel. Every action your workflows perform — from updating a spreadsheet cell to having AI summarize a document — uses credits. Simple tasks use fewer credits, while complex operations (like AI processing) use more.

It's like a pay-as-you-go system that scales with what you actually use.

### How credits work

**Automatic usage**: Credits get used automatically whenever your workflows run. No need to think about it — your automations just work, and credits handle the behind-the-scenes costs.

**Track your usage**: Keep an eye on your credit consumption right from your main Dashboard, or dive deeper in Settings > Billing. You'll see exactly what's using credits and how much you have left.

### Adding more credits

Running low on credits? No worries:

1. **Go to Settings > Wallet** — Everything's right where you'd expect
2. **Click "Add Top Up Wallet"** — Can't miss it
3. **Pick your amount** — Choose the credit amount that fits your needs
4. **Complete the purchase** — Your credits show up instantly

**Pro tip:** Buy credits in larger packages for better value, and you won't have to think about topping up as often.

### Understanding usage

**Workflow executions** are the main unit:

* Each time an automation runs counts as one execution
* Scheduled runs, trigger events, and manual runs all count
* Failed runs still count (they used resources)

**Resource consumption**

* Longer-running workflows use more compute
* File processing and web scraping are resource-intensive
* API calls to external services may have their own costs
