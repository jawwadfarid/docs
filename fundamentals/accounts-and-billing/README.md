# Accounts and Billing

### Pricing

CodeWords currently uses a usage-based pricing model.

Pricing reflects our standard processing rates. Usage rates vary depending on the process you're completing, such as using our web agent or calling integrations.

We'll be developing our pricing flexibility soon, but for now you'll be able to build and test out the platform at a lower rate so you can explore everything that CodeWords has to offer.

### Credits Usage

Every action your workflows perform — from updating a spreadsheet cell to having AI summarize a document — uses credits. Simple tasks use fewer credits, while complex operations (like AI processing) use more.

It's a pay-as-you-go system that scales with what you actually use.

#### Building automations

Our current pricing reflects that our platform is still early, and we want our users to feel empowered to build and experiment when building automations.

On average, building an automation by chatting with Cody will cost between **$0.50 - $2**. Extensive or highly complex automations might cost more than this.

#### Editing automations

Updating and customizing templates usually costs between **$0.1 - $1** on average. Very complex customizations might cost more than this.

#### Running automations

On average, running workflows from a template costs between **$0.00001 - $1.**

Please note that our usage-based pricing varies depending on how complex your workflow is and how many other tools are used in the process.

You'll be able to cancel any scheduled or triggered automations at any point.&#x20;

**Note:** you might still incur some limited overspill charges whilst your cancellation takes place.

### How credits work

**Automatic usage:** Credits get used automatically whenever your workflows run. No need to think about it — your automations just work, and credits handle the behind-the-scenes costs.

**Track your usage:** Keep an eye on your credit consumption right from your main Dashboard, or dive deeper in Settings > Billing. You'll see exactly what's using credits and how much you have left.

### Adding more credits

Running low on credits? No worries:

1. **Go to Settings > Wallet** — Everything's right where you'd expect
2. **Click "Add Top Up Wallet"** — Can't miss it
3. **Pick your amount** — Choose the credit amount that fits your needs
4. **Complete the purchase** — Your credits show up instantly

**Pro tip:** Buy credits in larger packages for better value, and you won't have to think about topping up as often.

### Understanding usage

**Workflow executions** are the main unit:

* Each time an automation runs counts as one execution
* Scheduled runs, trigger events, and manual runs all count
* Failed runs still count (they used resources)
* Tool callings and the user messages to Cody are also considered part of the usage, but they amount to very minimal consumption of your credits.

**Resource consumption**

* Longer-running workflows use more compute
* File processing and web scraping are resource-intensive
* API calls to external services may have their own costs
