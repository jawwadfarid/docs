# Pricing information

### Pricing Overview

CodeWords currently uses a **usage-based** pricing model.

Pricing reflects our standard processing rates. Usage rates vary depending on the process you’re completing, such as using our web agent or calling integrations.

We’ll be developing our pricing flexibility soon, but for now you’ll be able to build and test out the platform at a lower rate so you can explore everything that CodeWords has to offer.

### **Running automations**

On average, running workflows from a template costs between $0.00001 - $1.

Please note that our usage-based pricing varies depending on how complex your workflow is and how many other tools are used in the process.

You’ll be able to cancel any scheduled or triggered automations at any point.

**Note:** you might still incur some limited overspill charges whilst your cancellation takes place.

### **Editing automations**

Updating and customizing templates usually costs between $0.1 - $1 on average.

Very complex customizations might cost more than this.

### **Building automations**

Our current pricing reflects that our platform is still early, and we want our users to feel empowered to build and experiment when building automations.

On average, building an automation by chatting with Cody will cost between $0.50 - $2. Extensive or highly complex automations might cost more than this.

We’re working on making our pricing model as transparent as possible.
