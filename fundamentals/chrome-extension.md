# Chrome Extension

### Introduction

The CodeWords Chrome extension automates tasks on websites where you're already logged in. It runs directly in your browser, using your existing sessions to access private content like LinkedIn feeds, dashboards, and member-only pages.

### When to use the Chrome extension

Perfect for:

* Getting content from private pages (LinkedIn feeds, dashboards)
* Simple website tasks like clicking buttons or filling forms
* When reliability is more important than speed

Not ideal for:

* Scheduled automations when you're away
* When you need to use your browser simultaneously
* When speed is critical

### Getting started

1. Install: [Chrome Web Store link](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/codewords/fgcbeegcaikofigbnfmmlgcimdkmfnce)
2. Log in: Sign in to websites you want to automate

### What it can do

| Function            | Best for                              | Speed          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Page scraping       | Get content from private pages        | 30-60 seconds  |
| Interactive actions | Click buttons, fill forms             | 60-120 seconds |
| Cookie extraction   | Share login sessions with other tools | 10-30 seconds  |

### Performance expectations

* Reliable: Very consistent results using your real browser
* Visible: You can watch automations happen in real-time
* Slower: Takes longer than other tools, but is more dependable
* Browser control: Uses one tab while running

### Best practices

* Test your automation manually first
* Stay logged in to target websites
* Be patient — good results take time

### Common use cases

* Monitor LinkedIn feeds and collect posts
* Extract data from company dashboards
* Gather content from member-only sites
* Automate repetitive form filling

The Chrome extension trades speed for reliability — perfect when you need consistent results from authenticated websites.
