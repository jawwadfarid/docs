# Web Agent

### Intro

The **Web Agent** is your **AI-powered assistant for browser automation**.\
Instead of writing complex scripts, you can simply **describe your goal in plain language**, and the Web Agent figures out how to achieve it — by navigating websites, clicking buttons, and collecting the information you need.

Think of it as a **virtual assistant that can browse the web and complete tasks for you**.

### When to use the Web Agent



1. **Complex research tasks** where you don’t know all the steps

Example: “Find the CEO’s email on the company website — check the About page, Team page, or Contact form.”

2. **Dynamic websites** that change often (e.g. LinkedIn, news sites)
3. **Exploratory automation** that requires decision-making

Example: “Search for product reviews and summarize the top 5 complaints.”

4. **Authenticated websites** behind logins (e.g. LinkedIn profiles, private dashboards)

### **How It Works**

{% step %}
#### Describe your goal

Write a few clear, step-by-step instructions to Cody

"Go to the company website, find the about or team page & locate the CEO’s name and email address."
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### The Agent executes the task

The Web Agent:

* Reads and understands your instructions
* Navigates the website automatically
* Clicks the right links and buttons
* Extracts the requested information
* Returns results in your chosen format (text, JSON, or Markdown)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### **Watch It Work**

You can watch the Web Agent in real time through a live browser view — perfect for monitoring progress and debugging.
