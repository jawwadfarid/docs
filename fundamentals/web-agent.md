# Web Agent

Many essential tasks happen on websites that donâ€™t offer a public API. The Web agent feature solves this by acting like a robotic assistant that can interact with websites on your behalf.

You can deploy the web agent to perform tasks like:

* Filling out forms on a website automatically.
* Extracting product prices, stock levels, or news headlines.
* Monitoring a page for specific changes.

This feature dramatically expands the reach of your automations, allowing you to connect to virtually any online tool or data source.
