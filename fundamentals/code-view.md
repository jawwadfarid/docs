# Code View

For technical users who want to look under the hood, the Code view displays the underlying configuration of your workflow. This provides a detailed, text-based representation of every step, parameter, and integration.

The Code view is perfect for:

* Advanced debugging to see the exact data being passed between steps.
* Fine-tuning specific parameters that may not be visible in the main interface.
* Backing up or versioning your workflows using external tools.

You can access this by selecting the Code view tab in the workflow editor.
