Pipedream integrations & AI models, APIs (voice, OCR...)



Beyond building automations with Cody, you can also embed the power of AI directly _inside_ your workflows. The AI models feature allows you to add steps that use generative AI to process, transform, or create new content.

This turns a simple automation that just moves data into an intelligent workflow that understands and acts on it. Common uses include:

* Summarizing long emails or documents into a few key bullet points.
* Analyzing customer feedback from a survey to determine its sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative).
* Drafting personalized replies to customer inquiries.
* Translating text from one language to another automatically.
