# Intro to apps and integrations

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Y0bqu9I3c" %}

### Overview

CodeWords integrates with over 2,800 apps and integrations.&#x20;

You can browse most of our integrations through our [integrations page](https://codewords.agemo.ai/account/integrations), and you can also connect to external tools using an API key.&#x20;

### Connecting to integrations directly

Any integration listed directly in the integrations page can be connected in a couple of clicks.&#x20;

You can do this in a few ways, for example:&#x20;

* Search and connect directly to an integration via our [integrations page](https://codewords.agemo.ai/account/integrations).&#x20;
* Connect whilst you're building an automation by clicking on the integration's graph node and clicking `Connect` .&#x20;
* From a run page, select the integrations dropdown and click `Connect` to the necessary integrations.&#x20;

Simply follow the instructions to connect and integrate without needing any technical configuration.&#x20;

Whenever an integration is required, you'll be prompted to connect to it. After you've connected once, you won't need to do this step again.&#x20;

### External integrations

Beyond built-in app integrations, CodeWords provides several powerful ways to connect your workflows to external systems:

1. [CodeWords API key](https://codewords.agemo.ai/account/keys?utm_source=docs): Use your API key to connect to any external service securely.
2. [Webhooks](https://docs.codewords.ai/fundamentals/webhooks): Open HTTP endpoints that let external services send data directly to your workflows via HTTP POST requests.
3. [Triggers](https://docs.codewords.ai/fundamentals/triggers): App-based triggers allow you to start workflows automatically from your favorite apps and services.
4. [External APIs](https://docs.codewords.ai/fundamentals/external-api-integration): Workflows in CodeWords are written as Python scripts, enabling seamless integration with any external API. This allows our agent to connect to and interact with third-party systems easily.
5. CodeWords client Integration: Integrate your workflows with custom user interfaces built using platforms like [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/), [V0](https://v0.app/) & more.
