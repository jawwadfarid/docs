# Activity

#### What is the Activity page?

The Activity page is where you see everything that has happened or is planned in your workspace: your past chats, workflow runs, scheduled runs, and triggers. You can open it from the sidebar by clicking Activity (history icon).

#### What you can do there

The page has four tabs at the top. You switch between them to see different kinds of activity.

**1. Chats**

* List of your past chat sessions.
* You can search and change the sort order (newest or oldest first).
* Use this when you want to find or reopen an earlier conversation.

**2. Run**

* List of workflow runs (when a workflow actually ran).
* You can search, sort by date or cost, filter by status (e.g. success, failed, running), and by how the run was started (scheduled, manual, or trigger).
* Use this to see what ran, when, and whether it succeeded or failed.

**3. Scheduled Runs**

* List of schedules (when runs are set to run automatically in the future).
* You can search by name or schedule details.
* All times are shown in your local timezone.
* Use this to see and manage what’s set to run on a schedule.

**4. Triggers**

* List of triggers (events that can start a run automatically).
* You can search through triggers and scroll to load more.
* Use this to see what triggers exist and how they’re set up.
