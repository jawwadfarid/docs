# Introduction to Cody

### What is Cody?

Cody is your AI automation assistant that builds powerful workflows and AI agents through natural conversation. Unlike traditional workflow builders that rely on drag-and-drop blocks, Cody generates real automation code for you, collaborates with you to understand your needs, and handles complex, multi-step logic that other tools can’t.

### How it works

#### 1. Understanding your needs

Describe what you want to achieve in natural language.

Cody then analyzes your goal, determines the required steps, logic, and app integrations, and presents a clear plan in the form of a Todo list.&#x20;

You'll review, edit, and approve this plan before Cody begins building.

#### 2. Clarifying questions

At any stage of the process, if Cody needs more information or context, it will proactively ask follow-up questions to ensure it fully understands your goal. This helps refine your workflow and guarantees that the final automation behaves exactly as you intend.

#### 3. Building the workflow

Once you've approved the automation, Cody writes the code and connects all the necessary integrations to power your workflow automation or AI agents. You'll be prompted to connect to any app or integration that Cody doesn't already have access to.&#x20;

Cody handles the technical details behind the scenes, ensuring your workflow is efficient, reliable, and production-ready without you having to write a single line of code.

#### 4. Automatic testing, debugging, and deploying

Once approved, Cody deploys your automation and runs real-data tests to verify that every step performs as expected. It validates integrations, logic, and outputs to ensure everything functions smoothly. If any issues arise during testing, Cody automatically reviews the workflow logs, identifies the root cause, and applies fixes, keeping your automation running reliably without manual debugging.

### What you can do

Cody empowers you to create, modify, and manage automations and AI agents using natural conversation, without the need for coding.&#x20;

* **Build new workflows:**\
  Turn your ideas into fully functional AI-powered automations. Just describe what you want (from lead tracking to content generation) and Cody builds it end-to-end.
* **Modify existing workflows:**\
  Instantly update, extend, or optimize your workflows. Add new steps, connect different apps, or refine automation logic without touching any code.
* **Debug and optimize:**\
  When something doesn’t work as expected, Cody automatically inspects logs, identifies issues, and helps you fix or optimize the workflow for better performance.
* **Connect with other platforms:**\
  Integrate seamlessly with external apps or custom apps built on Lovable, Bolt, V0, and much more.

### Why Cody is different

#### Conversational automation

Unlike traditional workflow builders that rely on drag-and-drop interfaces or complex form setups, Cody lets you build through natural conversation. Simply describe your goal in plain English, and Cody translates it into a working automation, instantly.

#### Real code without any coding

While most automation tools use predefined actions, Cody generates real Python automation code behind the scenes. This means it can handle complex logic, multi-step workflows, and deep API integrations that rigid no-code builders can’t.

With Cody, you get the flexibility of coding and the ease of conversation — an intelligent agent that thinks, builds, and adapts like a developer, without requiring one.
