# Running automations

### Running workflow automations

There are a few different ways you can run workflow automations in CodeWords.&#x20;

#### **Run directly from chat**

You can run workflows directly from the chat where the workflow was built by clicking `Run` . By doing so, you can quickly see how your workflow performs, and check that you're happy with the output.&#x20;

#### **Run page overview**

Each time a workflow is executed (manually, on schedule, or via a trigger) a new Run page is generated.&#x20;

**Each run page includes:**

* **Integrations**: A dropdown where you can check if integration connections are required to run the workflow.&#x20;
* **Input fields**: Here's where you enter your unique data or reference points.&#x20;
* **Run button**: You'll be able to click `Run` once you've filled in the required input fields.&#x20;
* **Workflow logs**: After you've clicked `Run` , you'll be able to see which workflow action is currently in progress as the logs are updating.&#x20;
* **Output**: Once your workflow has finished running, you'll receive your automated output.&#x20;
* **Error details:** An alert error if your workflow has failed. From here, you'll be able to go back to the chat and ask Cody to fix it.&#x20;

If an automation doesn’t behave as expected, head back to the chat, reference your workflow, and ask Cody to fix it.&#x20;

### Schedules and triggers&#x20;

You can choose whether you'd like to run your automation manually, or whether you'd like to set up a schedule or trigger that fully automated the workflow's process.&#x20;
