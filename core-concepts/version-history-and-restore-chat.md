# Version history and restore (chat)

### Overview

When you build and change automations in the chat with Cody, you don’t have to worry about losing earlier versions. CodeWords keeps a version history for your chat so you can see what changed, preview an older version, and restore it if you want to go back.This helps you try new ideas safely and undo changes without starting from scratch.

### What is version history?

* Versions are snapshots of your automation at different points in time (e.g. after you or Cody made changes).
* Version history is the list of those snapshots. You can see when each version was created and, in many cases, a short description of what it contains.
* Descriptions are often generated automatically so you can quickly tell versions apart.

### Viewing version history

You can open version history from the chat interface:

1. In the chat where you’re building or editing the automation, look for the option to open version history or versions (often in the header or a menu).
2. Open it to see a list of versions, usually with:

* When the version was created
* A short description of the version
* Option to preview or restore

### Previewing a version

Before you restore an old version, you can preview it:

1. Open version history.
2. Find the version you’re interested in.
3. Choose Preview (or similar).
4. The interface will show you that version’s state (e.g. workflow steps, inputs) so you can decide if you want to restore it.
5. When you’re done, you can close the preview and stay on your current version, or choose Restore for that version.

Preview lets you “look without changing” so you don’t accidentally revert.

### Restoring a version

Restore means making that older version your current one again:

1. Open version history.
2. Find the version you want to go back to (use preview if you’re not sure).
3. Choose Restore (and confirm if asked).
4. Your automation will switch back to that version. You can keep editing from there.

Restoring does not delete newer versions; they stay in history so you can switch again later if you want.

### When to use version history

* You tried a change and want to undo it.
* You want to compare an older idea with the current one (preview first).
* You need to go back to a known-good state after experiments.
* You want to see what changed over time (descriptions and timestamps help).
