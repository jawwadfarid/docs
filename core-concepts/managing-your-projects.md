# Managing your Projects

### Overview

Projects in CodeWords are your automations: each project is a workflow or an app you build and run. Folders are how you group those projects so you can organize and filter them instead of one long list.

### What are projects and folders?

* Projects

A project is a single automation—a workflow or an app. When you create a “project,” you’re creating the thing that runs on a schedule, trigger, or manually. So “projects” and “workflows/apps” are the same thing.

* Folders

Folders are the organizing layer. You put projects (workflows/apps) inside folders (e.g. “Marketing”, “Support”, “Personal”). Folders don’t run; they just help you find and manage your projects.

### Viewing projects and folders

* Projects list

You’ll see your projects (your workflows and apps) as cards or a list. Each item is one automation. You can open a project to run it, edit it in chat, or set up schedules and triggers.

* Folders

Folders appear as groups or filters. You can open a folder to see only the projects inside it, or filter the list by folder so you’re not scrolling through everything.

* Filters

When choosing which automation to run or manage, you can filter by folder to show only the projects in that folder.

### Creating and organizing

* Create a project

Creating a new project means creating a new workflow or app. You then build it in the chat with Cody, add steps, and set schedules or triggers as needed.

* Create a folder

Create a folder when you want a group (e.g. “Weekly reports”, “Slack bots”). Then move or assign existing projects into that folder, or create new projects inside it.

* Moving projects

When editing or managing a project (workflow/app), you can change which folder it’s in so it appears in the right group.

### Run page and folder context

When you open a project’s run page, CodeWords knows which folder that project is in. Schedules, triggers, and run options are set per project (per workflow/app); folders only affect how you browse and filter.

### When to use folders

* Different teams, clients, or areas (work vs personal).
* Types of automation (e.g. “Reports”, “Notifications”, “Slack”).
* Keeping the list manageable by filtering to one folder at a time.
