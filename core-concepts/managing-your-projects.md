# Managing your Projects

### Overview

As the number of automations grows, projects and folders help you keep things organized. You can group related workflows, see them in one place, and filter by project or folder when you run or manage them.

### What are projects and folders?

* Projects are high-level containers (e.g. “Marketing”, “Support”, “Personal”). Each project can contain multiple workflows and folders.
* Folders live inside a project and let you group workflows more finely (e.g. “Weekly reports” or “Slack bots” inside “Marketing”).

Together they give you a clear structure instead of one long list of automations.

### Viewing projects and folders

* Projects page

You’ll see a list of your projects (often as cards or a list). From here you can open a project to see its workflows and folders.

* Inside a project

You’ll see folders and individual workflows. You can open a folder to see only the workflows in that folder.

* Filters

In places where you choose which automation to run or manage, you can often filter by project or folder so you only see the relevant automations.

### Creating and organizing

* Create a project

Use the option to create a new project (e.g. “New project” or “Create project”), give it a name, and optionally a description. Then add workflows or folders to it.

* Create a folder

Inside a project, use “New folder” or “Create folder”, name it, and move or add workflows into it.

* Moving workflows

When editing or managing a workflow, you can usually change its project or folder so it appears in the right group.

### Run page and project context

When you open an automation’s run page (where you run it manually or set schedules and triggers), CodeWords knows which project (and folder) that workflow belongs to. That way, any project-level settings or filters stay consistent when you run it or set up schedules and triggers.

### When to use projects and folders

* Projects: Different teams, clients, or areas of life (work vs personal).
* Folders: Sub-categories inside a project (e.g. “Daily”, “On-demand”, “Slack”).
* Filters: When you have many automations and want to see only one project or folder at a time.
