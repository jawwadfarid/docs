# The building process

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?index=7&list=PL7YjPR6szESdTd48XHREyHb--WijhwbdE&pp=gAQBiAQBsAgC&v=iGOU6tw01T8" %}

We've already gone through how you can [get started](https://docs.codewords.ai/~/revisions/L3KYUYRQXXSgj0yJcK7c/get-started/quickstart) and how to [build your first automation](https://docs.codewords.ai/~/revisions/L3KYUYRQXXSgj0yJcK7c/get-started/build-your-first-automation), but let's go through some more of the details of the building process. &#x20;

You can get started building your own automations simply by prompting. Let's recap what this looks like.&#x20;

### Prompt: Describe your idea <a href="#prompt-describe-your-idea" id="prompt-describe-your-idea"></a>

Head to the chat interface and start by describing what you want to build in natural language. CodeWords will clarify the automation idea with you and build it end-to-end.&#x20;

Try these simple prompts to get started:

* **"A workflow that monitors feature launches on my competitor websites"**
* **"A workflow that extracts the transcript from YouTube videos"**
* **"A workflow that enriches my LinkedIn name list with contact info"**
* **"A workflow that sends this form when someone submits an inquiry"**

If you're not sure what you'd like to build, you can ask Cody for ideas. Give Cody some context about a problem you're trying to solve, a task that creates friction day-to-day that you'd love to solve, or what your job role looks like.&#x20;

### Collaboration and communication with Cody&#x20;

As covered in our [Introduction to Cody](https://docs.codewords.ai/~/revisions/L3KYUYRQXXSgj0yJcK7c/core-concepts/introduction-to-cody), once you've decided what you'd like to build, Cody will ask you some clarifying questions.&#x20;

Clarifying questions are designed to hone in and refine your automation idea before Cody starts to build it.&#x20;

For example:&#x20;

* Where would you like this output to be sent?&#x20;
* How often would you like this workflow to run?
* What should the focus area of this workflow be?

If you want, you can skip a question or let Cody decide for you.&#x20;

Once ready, Cody will ask you if you're ready for it to start building. You can either confirm this, or continue to iterate on your idea with Cody in the chat.&#x20;

Cody will also ask you if you'd like to build the workflow first and test it later, or test it as it's built. It doesn't matter which route you choose, Cody will still test the workflow and automatically debug any errors.&#x20;

### Todo lists

Once you're ready for Cody to start building, Cody will produce a todo list for you.&#x20;

This gives you an overview of all the steps that will take place to produce your end automation result.&#x20;

You'll be able to see which step is completed, currently in progress, and still todo.&#x20;

### The building process

Cody will update the chat throughout the building process so that you can see what's currently happening.&#x20;

You'll be able to see what's currently in progress. For example, building, debugging, or preparing to ask you a question.&#x20;

Cody will test, debug, and deploy your workflow for you throughout this process. When your workflow is ready to be deployed, Cody will release some "CodeWords confetti" to confirm that his has happened.&#x20;

### Using your deployed workflow&#x20;

Once Cody has deployed your workflow, it will tell you that this has happened and provide you a unique URL. This will take you straight to your workflow's run page so you can start using your workflow automation.&#x20;

You can also find and manage your latest workflow in the [My Workflows](https://codewords.agemo.ai/workflows/library) tab.&#x20;

### Making changes to your workflow&#x20;

If you still want to make adjustments to your workflow after it's been deployed, you can head back to your recent chat with Cody and ask it to make edits to your workflow.&#x20;

In this case, the building process will restart, but this time just to update your existing workflow base.&#x20;
