# Templates and Projects

### What are automation templates?

**Templates** are packaged and ready-to-use automations or tools. There are usually two types.&#x20;

* Automations that don't have an interface, but can be run via schedules, adding triggers, or through the chat.&#x20;
* End-to-end tools that have both a backend automation and frontend interface. You can use these tools by interacting through the interface.&#x20;

Each template is tested, optimized, and ready to use, so you can focus on your goals instead of setup. Templates give you immediate access to powerful, no-code workflows that replace hours of manual or technical work.&#x20;

They help you:

* Automate research, outreach, monitoring, and analysis.
* Get consistent, high-quality results every time.
* Save time and eliminate repetitive tasks.

Whether you’re tracking competitors, enriching leads, summarizing content, or processing reports — templates do the heavy lifting for you.

### Where can I find templates?

There are two main places you'll have access to templates:

* [**Templates**](https://codewords.agemo.ai/template-gallery): A collection of pre-built automation templates from the CodeWords community. You can take the following actions from these templates:&#x20;
  * **Use template**: Run the automation, set up schedules or triggers, or customize the template to make it your own, all via the chat.&#x20;
  * **View app**: When there's both a backend automation and interface for a template, you can head straight to the app to use straightaway.&#x20;
* [**Projects**](https://codewords.agemo.ai/workflows/library): Where you'll find all the automations and tools that you've built with CodeWords.&#x20;
  * After Cody has finished building your automation in the chat, you'll be given a URL that takes you straight to your template's run page. You'll be able to return to those templates in the Projects section.&#x20;

You can find specific automation templates for your use case by using the search bar or picking a preset category tag on the Templates page, for example for WhatsApp, Productivity, or Sales.&#x20;

The **Templates** page allows you to do the following:

* **Run the automation**: Select a template, click `Use Template`, and you'll be taken to the chat. From here, you can run that automation, set up a schedule, add in a trigger, or customize the template — all via the chat.&#x20;
* **Set up schedules and triggers**: Select a template, click `Use Template` and from the chat you'll be able to ask for a schedule or trigger of your choice to be added.&#x20;

The **Projects** page allows you to do the following:&#x20;

* **View and manage your automations and apps:** Click a template and you'll be taken to its overview page. Here you can head to the chat, copy and customize the workflow, setup and manage schedules and triggers, view costs, and see all versions.  &#x20;
* **Share**: Click the template and select `Share` to share this workflow template with friends, teammates, or to social media.&#x20;

### How to use templates

#### 1. Explore available templates

Browse the [**Templates**](https://codewords.agemo.ai/template-gallery) page to see pre-built automations and apps for and range of use cases.

For example:&#x20;

* Lead research and enrichment
* Competitor and content monitoring
* Communication and marketing workflows
* Data organization and analysis

Each template includes clear setup instructions, inputs required, and sample results.

#### 2. Choose your template

Pick a template that fits a real use case in your workflow.&#x20;

Testing with actual data helps you learn faster and see value immediately.

#### 3. Run the template

Running a template is simple:

1. Click a template.
2. Select `Use template` and you'll be taken to the chat interface. Here you'll be prompted to add in your integrations so you can use it.&#x20;
3. Fill in your input data according to the required fields.&#x20;
4. Click `Run` . You'll be able to see the estimated cost and time it takes to run this automation from the run button.&#x20;

Your automation will run and deliver your output.

#### 4. Edit a template

If you want to edit a template to better-align with your use case and tech stack, click `Use template` and you'll be taken straight to the chat. From there, you can update and customize the template to fit your intended outputs and tools.&#x20;

For example, these are some edits you might wish to make:&#x20;

* "Change the output format to a PDF report"
* "Add trend analysis to this workflow"&#x20;
* "Use Telegram instead of WhatsApp"&#x20;

Cody updates the automation automatically, so you can customize without needing to update any code.
