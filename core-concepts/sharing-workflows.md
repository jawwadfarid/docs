# Sharing workflows

### How to share a workflow

Once you've finished building, share it with a friend, colleague, or someone you think would safe time with your CodeWords workflow.&#x20;

You can do this by heading to the run page of the workflow you'd like to share, and clicking the `Share` button in the top-right corner.&#x20;

#### Visibility and permissions

After clicking share, you can choose one of the following visibility options:&#x20;

* **Private:** Only you can access this workflow.
* **Selected access:** Only people you share this workflow with can see it.&#x20;
* **Public:** Anyone with the link can see this workflow — perfect for sharing on social media.&#x20;

This allows you to have run-level control over your workflow.&#x20;

If you select either&#x20;

* **Selected access**&#x20;

or

* **Public**&#x20;

You'll have control over whether you'd also like to share your integrations and secrets. This toggle exists so you never accidentally share API keys, secrets, or anything that should remain confidential.&#x20;

If you click **Selected access**, you'll be able to add selected accounts to your workflow by adding their email addresses. You can also share the link individually with these users.&#x20;

If you select **Public access**, simply copy the shareable link and share away! You can share workflows to social media (tag us, we like to reward people who share!) or you can share within group chats and with anyone you think would love your workflow.&#x20;

You can also share directly to social media by clicking the buttons for **X** or **LinkedIn.**&#x20;
