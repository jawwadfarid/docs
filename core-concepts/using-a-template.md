# Using a Template

### What are Templates?

Templates are ready-made automations designed to solve common business problems — from lead generation to data processing, without needing to build anything from scratch. Each template is tested, optimized, and ready to use, so you can focus on your goals instead of setup.

Templates give you immediate access to powerful, no-code workflows that replace hours of manual or technical work.\
They help you:

* Automate research, outreach, monitoring, and analysis.
* Get consistent, high-quality results every time.
* Save time and eliminate repetitive tasks.

Whether you’re tracking competitors, enriching leads, summarizing content, or processing reports — templates do the heavy lifting for you.

### Step-by-Step: How to Use Templates

#### 1. Explore Available Templates

Browse the **Template Gallery** to see pre-built automations for:

* Lead research and enrichment
* Competitor and content monitoring
* Communication and marketing workflows
* Data organization and analysis

Each template includes clear setup instructions, inputs required, and sample results.

#### 2. Choose Your First Template

Pick one that fits a real use case in your workflow. You don’t need to plan everything — testing with actual data helps you learn faster and see value immediately.

#### 3. Run the Template

Running a template is simple:

1. Click on any template.
2. Fill in your business or project details.
3. Hit **Run** and wait a few seconds for results.\
   Your automation will execute instantly, delivering clean, usable output.

#### 4. Edit a Template

Want to make it your own?

* Pick a template close to your needs.
* Click **Edit Template**.
* Ask **Cody** to modify it — for example:\
  “Add competitor analysis to this workflow” or “Change the output format to a  PDF report.”

Cody updates the automation automatically, so you can customize without touching code.
