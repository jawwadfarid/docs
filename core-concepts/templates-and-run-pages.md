# Templates

### What are automation templates?

**Templates** are packaged and ready-to-use automations or tools. There are usually two types.&#x20;

* Automations that don't have an interface, but can be run via schedules, adding triggers, or through the chat.&#x20;
* End-to-end tools that have both a backend automation and frontend interface. You can use these tools by interacting through the interface.&#x20;

Each template is tested, optimized, and ready to use, so you can focus on your goals instead of setup. Templates give you immediate access to powerful, no-code workflows that replace hours of manual or technical work.&#x20;

They help you:

* Automate research, outreach, monitoring, and analysis.
* Get consistent, high-quality results every time.
* Save time and eliminate repetitive tasks.

Whether you’re tracking competitors, enriching leads, summarizing content, or processing reports — templates do the heavy lifting for you.

### Where can I find templates?

There are two main places you'll have access to templates:

* [**Templates**](https://codewords.agemo.ai/template-gallery): A collection of pre-built automation templates from the CodeWords community.&#x20;
* [**Projects**](https://codewords.agemo.ai/workflows/library): Where you'll find all the automations and tools that you've built with CodeWords.&#x20;
  * After Cody has finished building your automation in the chat, you'll be given a URL that takes you straight to your template's run page. You'll be able to return to those templates in the Projects section.&#x20;

You can find specific automation templates for your use case by using the search bar or picking a preset category tag on the Templates page, for example for WhatsApp, Productivity, or Sales.&#x20;

Templates in both locations allow you to do the following:

* **Run your automation**: Click to a template to head straight to its overview page. From here you can run that automation by clicking `Run`, set up a schedule, add in a trigger, or customize the template via the chat.
* **Click to Open Chat**: Click `Open Chat` to run, edit, or update the template.&#x20;
* **Schedule**: Click the template and select `Schedule` to automatically run the automation at set times.&#x20;
* **Set up trigger:** Click the template and select&#x20;
* **Share**: Click the template and select `Share` to share this workflow template with friends, teammates, or to social media.&#x20;

### How to use templates and run pages

#### 1. Explore available templates

Browse the [**Template Gallery**](https://codewords.agemo.ai/template-gallery) to see pre-built automations for and range of use cases.

For example:&#x20;

* Lead research and enrichment
* Competitor and content monitoring
* Communication and marketing workflows
* Data organization and analysis

Each template includes clear setup instructions, inputs required, and sample results.

#### 2. Choose your template

Pick a template that fits a real use case in your workflow.&#x20;

Testing with actual data helps you learn faster and see value immediately.

#### 3. Run the template

Running a template is simple:

1. Click a template.
2. Connect to any required integrations by selecting the integrations dropdown.
3. Fill in your input data according to the required fields.&#x20;
4. Click `Run` . You'll be able to see the estimated cost and time it takes to run this automation from the run button.&#x20;

Your automation will run and deliver your output.

#### 4. Edit a template

If you want to edit a template to better-align with your use case and tech stack, click `Edit` and describe what you'd like to happen.&#x20;

For example, these are some edits you might wish to make:&#x20;

* "Change the output format to a PDF report"
* "Add trend analysis to this workflow"&#x20;
* "Use Telegram instead of WhatsApp"&#x20;

Cody updates the automation automatically, so you can customize without needing to update any code.

### FAQs

<details>

<summary>How does editing a template work with versioning?</summary>

When you ask Cody to edit a template, you can specify whether it's a change that needs to be made to the existing version, or whether you want to create copy the template and alter the new version of it. Just add this to your initial prompt.

<summary>The workflow ran into an error on the run page, how do I fix this?</summary>

If CodeWords hits an error on the run page, a 'Fix it' button will appear. Click this button and describe in the chat what happened, then ask Cody to fix it. Cody will run through tests, debug, and troubleshoot the error that occurred. It will then redeploy your workflow so you can continue using it.&#x20;
