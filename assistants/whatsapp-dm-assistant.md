# WhatsApp DM Assistant

### What are WhatsApp DM Assistants

WhatsApp Direct Messaging (DM) Assistants lets you send messages to individual users (not groups) through WhatsApp. It’s the user-facing side of WhatsApp automation, powered by the official WhatsApp Business API from Meta/Facebook.

Think of it like:

* 📧 **Email marketing** → but on WhatsApp with **98% open rates**
* 📲 **SMS alerts** → but richer with images, links, and **two-way chat**

### CodeWords WhatsApp Business Number

**+447424366129** — the official CodeWords WhatsApp Business account.

* All **user** messages come from this verified number
* Users can save it as a contact
* Available **24/7** for automation

### Setting Up Your First DM Assistant

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Build the Assistant through chat

Describe the kind of WhatsApp assistant you want to create along with its trigger.

Example: "Create a WhatsApp assistant that’s connected to an LLM and automatically responds to any message that I send back. Also make sure that its connected to my google calendar, such that It has access to view, edit, list and create events on my calendar. "
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Provide your phone number

Cody will ask which phone number you want your AI assistant to connect to. Once connected and the Assistant is built your Assistant will send you a welcome message.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Test your Assistant

Send any message — the assistant will detect it and respond through your Custom WhatsApp DM Assistant.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

**Note**: You can only have 1 Direct Messaging assistant at a time.
