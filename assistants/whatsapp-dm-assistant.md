# For WhatsApp DMs

### What are WhatsApp DM Automations

WhatsApp Direct Messaging (DM) automations allows you to consume codewords workflows that have been connected to your WhatsApp number.&#x20;

### CodeWords WhatsApp Business Number

**+447424366129** — the official CodeWords WhatsApp Business account.

* All **user** messages come from this verified number
* Users can save it as a contact
* Available **24/7** for automation

### Setting Up Your First DM Automation

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Build the Automation through chat

Describe the kind of WhatsApp auomation you want to create along with its trigger.

Example: "Create a WhatsApp assistant that’s connected to an LLM and automatically responds to any message that I send back. Also make sure that its connected to my google calendar, such that It has access to view, edit, list and create events on my calendar. "
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Provide your phone number

Cody will ask which phone number you want your AI assistant to connect to. Once connected and the Assistant is built your Assistant will send you a welcome message.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Test your Automation

Send any message — the assistant will detect it and respond through your Custom WhatsApp DM Assistant.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note**: You can only have 1 Direct Messaging assistant at a time.
{% endhint %}

Once your automation is set up, you can manage its WhatsApp trigger directly from the [Triggers](https://codewords.agemo.ai/workflows/triggers) page  including pausing or deleting it at any time.\
Alternatively, you can simply ask **Cody** to remove the trigger if you no longer want the automation to run.
