### Cost

| Automation Message Type       | Cost per Message                          | Examples                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Text, Poll, Event, Location   | ‚Ç¨0.002 + Cost of executing the Automation | ‚ÄúDaily update,‚Äù ‚ÄúNew event added‚Äù          |
| Image, Video, Audio, Document | ‚Ç¨0.004 + Cost of executing the Automation | Reports, media summaries                   |
| Receiving messages            | Free                                      | You only pay for what the Automation sends |

### Privacy & Data Handling

#### Key Principle: Ephemeral by Default

Your Automation runs in short-lived sandboxes ‚Äî fresh for every event and deleted right after.\
Each run lasts 2‚Äì30 seconds, then the environment is destroyed.

* Created new for each event
* Deleted after execution
* No local storage between runs
* No automatic data retention

**Meaning:**

* Your bot forgets everything after each run.
* Data is only kept if you _explicitly choose_ to store it.
* This ensures privacy-first design ‚Äî no accidental data retention.

### Getting Help

If your Assistant isn‚Äôt responding:

1. Confirm it‚Äôs linked (@CodeWords)
2. Ask Cody to verify your linked groups
3. Check in-app support or use live chat at [codewords.ai](https://codewords.agemo.ai/)
