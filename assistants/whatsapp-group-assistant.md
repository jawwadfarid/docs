### Privacy & Data Handling

#### Key Principle: Ephemeral by Default

Your Assistant runs in short-lived sandboxes — fresh for every event and deleted right after.\
Each run lasts 2–30 seconds, then the environment is destroyed.

* Created new for each event
* Deleted after execution
* No local storage between runs
* No automatic data retention

**Meaning:**

* Your bot forgets everything after each run.
* Data is only kept if you _explicitly choose_ to store it.
* This ensures privacy-first design — no accidental data retention.

### Getting Help

If your Assistant isn’t responding:

1. Confirm it’s linked (@CodeWords)
2. Ask Cody to verify your linked groups
3. Check in-app support or use live chat at [codewords.ai](https://codewords.agemo.ai/)
