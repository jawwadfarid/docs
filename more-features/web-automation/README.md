# Web automation

Web automation on CodeWords allows you to get more out of your automations by extracting dat a across your browser and applications.&#x20;

There are three main ways that CodeWords does this, including through the following:

* [**Firecrawl**](https://docs.codewords.ai/~/revisions/2IgKSsIuX4bzBsMZVaMc/apps-and-integrations/firecrawl-for-web-scraping)&#x20;
* [**Chrome extension**](https://docs.codewords.ai/~/revisions/2IgKSsIuX4bzBsMZVaMc/more-features/web-automation/chrome-extension)&#x20;
* [**Web agent**](https://docs.codewords.ai/~/revisions/2IgKSsIuX4bzBsMZVaMc/more-features/web-automation/web-agent)&#x20;

Click through to our dedicated pages to find out more about how each type works.&#x20;

Remember: You can use CodeWords solely for web automation if you wanted to. In this case, Cody wouldn't build an automation graph, it would only complete the web automation steps you specify and extract the corresponding data.&#x20;
