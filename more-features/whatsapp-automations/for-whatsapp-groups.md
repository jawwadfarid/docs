# For WhatsApp groups

### What are WhatsApp Group Automations

**WhatsApp Group Automations** help you manage your group chats. They can:

* Listen to messages and respond automatically
* Run predefined workflows
* Send announcements, reminders, and polls
* Welcome new members
* Track engagement and group activity
* Analyze messages to share insights

They are workflow automations that you can use to keep your WhatsApp groups active, organized, and responsive — even when you’re offline.

### How WhatsApp automations work

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### The Group

You add the **CodeWords WhatsApp number** (+447466216790) to your WhatsApp group to link an automation.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Event detection

The configured automation listens for your defined trigger, key events — like messages, reactions, or new members.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Trigger your Automation

When a trigger event happens, CodeWords automatically runs your custom Whatsapp Automation.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Processes & Responds

The workflow automation uses AI to analyze the message, take action, and send a response back to the group — just like a real assistant.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Event Types the WhatsApp Automations on CodeWords can Detect

| Event Type         | When It Happens              | Example Uses                         |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `message:in:new`   | When someone sends a message | Reply, log, or summarize content     |
| `group:update`     | Members join or leave        | Welcome messages, update tracking    |
| `message:update`   | Polls or event changes       | Share updated results                |
| `message:reaction` | Emoji reaction added         | Track engagement or popular messages |

### Setting Up Your First WhatsApp Assistant

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Build the Assistant through chat

Describe the kind of WhatsApp Assistant you want to create with your defined trigger, this can be a workflow automation.

Example 1: "Create a WhatsApp Assistant for my group that’s connected to an LLM and automatically responds to any message from group members."

Example 2: "Create a WhatsApp Assistant for my group that takes article URLs posted, adds it to my notion table with metadata. Only trigger if there is URL that is posted."
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Register your number

Tell **Cody** your number:

> “Register my phone number +447000000000 for the WhatsApp group Assistant.”

Cody will create your registration and send setup instructions.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Add the CodeWords number to your WhatsApp group

1. Open your group → Tap group name → “Add participant”
2. Add +447466216790
3. Confirm addition

You’ll see:

{% hint style="success" %}

{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Mention the Assistant

In your group, type:

```
@CodeWords
```

You’ll get confirmation:

{% hint style="success" %}
Assistant Successfully Linked!
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}

Send any message in the group — the Assistant will detect any trigger and respond through your Custom WhatsApp Group Assistant.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Connect an existing WhatsApp Automation template

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Access the template

Go to the Run Page for the WhatsApp Automation template and review its description to understand how it works.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Run the template

Enter your phone number (including country code), then run the Automation template  & register your number with the autuomation.

You’ll see:

Once your automation is set up, you can manage its WhatsApp trigger directly from the [Triggers](https://codewords.agemo.ai/workflows/triggers) page  including pausing or deleting it at any time.\
Alternatively, you can simply ask **Cody** to remove the trigger if you no longer want the automation to run.

### Cost

| Automation Message Type       | Cost per Message                          | Examples                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Text, Poll, Event, Location   | €0.002 + Cost of executing the Automation | “Daily update,” “New event added”          |
| Image, Video, Audio, Document | €0.004 + Cost of executing the Automation | Reports, media summaries                   |
| Receiving messages            | Free                                      | You only pay for what the Automation sends |

### Privacy & Data Handling

#### Key Principle: Ephemeral by Default

Your Automation runs in short-lived sandboxes — fresh for every event and deleted right after.\
Each run lasts 2–30 seconds, then the environment is destroyed.

* Created new for each event
* Deleted after execution
* No local storage between runs
* No automatic data retention

**Meaning:**

* Your bot forgets everything after each run.
* Data is only kept if you _explicitly choose_ to store it.
* This ensures privacy-first design — no accidental data retention.

### Getting Help

If your Assistant isn’t responding:

1. Confirm it’s linked (@CodeWords)
2. Ask Cody to verify your linked groups
3. Check in-app support or use live chat at [codewords.ai](https://codewords.agemo.ai/)
