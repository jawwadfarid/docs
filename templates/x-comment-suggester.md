# X Comment Suggester

<a href="https://codewords.agemo.ai/run/x_comment_suggester" class="button primary">Use this template</a>

## Overview

This automation pulls fresh posts from your X (Twitter) timeline through your browser and uses AI to craft thoughtful comment ideas you can post right away. It’s designed to help you build relationships and show up consistently without staring at a blank reply box. Behind the scenes, it opens your timeline with a browser extension, extracts the posts you’re likely to engage with, analyzes the tone and topic using AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash), and returns polished, ready-to-post comment suggestions—plus a clean HTML summary you can skim and click through.

## Description

This automation turns your X timeline into a tidy set of comment-ready prompts by combining your live browser session, AI technology, and a simple web endpoint into a single, shareable report. It first opens your authenticated X timeline in your browser using a browser extension, then scrolls and scrapes the page to capture posts and links. In parallel, it analyzes each post’s topic and tone with AI to find good engagement angles and drafts 2–3 short, varied comment suggestions for each. After processing the batch, it assembles everything into a neat HTML summary with direct links back to the original posts so you can review, pick your favorite, and reply quickly—saving time while keeping your voice consistent.
