### Overview

This automation monitors any Google Play app and keeps you informed about trends, issues, and opportunities—using AI to do the heavy lifting. It scrapes the app’s public store page, analyzes signals like ratings, reviews, and downloads, and turns that into clear insights you can act on. You’ll get smart alerts in Slack or email when something needs attention, plus a historical view so you can spot changes over time. It runs on a schedule, works through your browser-friendly API endpoint, and uses tools like Firecrawl for scraping and OpenAI for analysis so you don’t have to babysit the Play Store.

### Description

This automation tracks the health of a Google Play app by combining the public app page, AI technology, and simple notifications into a clean, readable analysis. It first fetches the app’s details from the Play Store, then uses AI to summarize performance, call out issues, and suggest next steps. In parallel, it stores snapshots in a lightweight history so you can see trends later. After the analysis is complete, it sends alerts to Slack (and optionally Gmail) based on the priority level you set, and it can schedule itself to check again automatically. The result is a quick, human-readable report that surfaces what matters and helps your team act faster.

### Key Features

**Google Play scraping**: Pulls app name, developer, rating, reviews, downloads, content rating, and last updated date using Firecrawl.

**AI performance insights**: Uses OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini) to generate a structured assessment with issues, recommendations, and business impact.

**Smart alerts**: Sends priority-based notifications to Slack and optional Gmail so the right people see the right updates.

**Historical tracking**: Stores snapshots in Redis, keeps the latest 50 records, and exposes a history endpoint for quick lookbacks.

**Caching and efficiency**: Reuses recent results (under 1 hour old) to avoid unnecessary scraping and analysis.

**Auto-scheduling**: Sets up recurring checks (e.g., every 24 hours) so monitoring continues without manual work.

**Configurable thresholds**: Only alert on Medium, High, or Critical issues—your choice—so you don’t get noisy pings.

**API-first design**: Clean FastAPI endpoints for on-demand monitoring and retrieving history, plus a webhook for scheduled runs.

### Instructions

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
Open the automation in CodeWords and connect your accounts (Slack and Gmail if you plan to use alerts).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Paste a Google Play app URL into the request field and choose your alert threshold (for example, Medium).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Pick your notification channels: confirm the Slack channel and optionally add a Gmail address for email alerts.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Choose how often you want this to run (for example, every 24 hours) and leave scheduling on if you want continuous monitoring.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Hit run to analyze the app now. The automation will scrape the page, generate AI insights, and save a snapshot to history.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Check your results in the response (and in Slack/email if enabled). You can also view past runs using the history endpoint.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Use Cases

This automation is perfect for product teams, growth marketers, and founders who want a quick, reliable read on how their app is performing in the Play Store—without manually checking every day. It’s great for keeping an eye on competitors too: set it to run on a schedule, receive alerts only when something meaningful changes, and use the history to spot trends and plan next steps.

### Frequently Asked Questions:

<details>

<summary><strong>What exactly does this automation analyze?</strong></summary>

It pulls public details from the Google Play page—app name, developer, rating, review volume, downloads, and more—then uses AI to highlight key issues, opportunities, and the likely business impact.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>How often does it run?</strong></summary>

By default, it schedules recurring checks (like every 24 hours), but you can change the interval or turn scheduling off. It also caches fresh results for an hour to avoid redundant runs.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Can I control when alerts are sent?</strong></summary>

Yes. Set a minimum alert level (None, Low, Medium, High, Critical). If the AI flags something below that level, notifications are skipped to reduce noise.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Where do alerts show up?</strong></summary>

You can send alerts to Slack (a specific channel) and optionally to Gmail. Slack uses your bot token; Gmail sends through a connected Pipedream integration.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Does it store history?</strong></summary>

Yes. It saves snapshots in Redis and keeps the latest 50 records per app. You can fetch past runs via the /app/{app\_id}/history endpoint.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What AI model does it use?</strong></summary>

It uses OpenAI’s gpt-4o-mini to produce structured insights (performance score, alert level, issues, recommendations) parsed into a typed schema.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What if the Google Play page changes?</strong></summary>

The scraper and parsers are robust, but if a page layout changes, the automation may raise a parsing error. You’ll see a clear 422 response and logs so you can retry later or adjust.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Is my data secure?</strong></summary>

Tokens like your CodeWords API key, Slack bot token, and Gmail connection are kept as environment variables or managed integrations. Messages are sent only to the channels you configure.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Can I monitor multiple apps?</strong></summary>

Absolutely. Trigger the automation with different Play Store URLs. Each app keeps its own history and schedule.
