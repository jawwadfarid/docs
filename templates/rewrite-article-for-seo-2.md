### Overview

This automation takes any article on the web and rewrites it for better SEO using AI. You paste a URL, add your target keywords, and include any formatting or style notes you care about. It pulls clean content from the page, rewrites it into polished markdown, and gives you a ready-to-download HTML file. It’s a fast way to turn existing posts into search-friendly content—no copying, pasting, or manual cleanup required.

### Description

This automation rewrites any web article for SEO by combining the original page content, your target keywords, and your style preferences into a clean markdown draft and a downloadable HTML file. It first fetches the article and extracts just the main content in readable markdown, then uses AI technology to rewrite it with your keywords and tone. In parallel, it prepares a styled HTML version you can use right away. After processing your notes on formatting and writing style, it converts the markdown to HTML and securely uploads the file, returning a link you can download and share. The result is an SEO-focused article that’s easy to publish and tailored to your brand voice.

### Frequently Asked Questions
