# LinkedIn Comment Replier

<a href="https://codewords.agemo.ai/run/linkedin_comment_replier" class="button primary">Use this template</a>

## Overview

This automation reads a LinkedIn post, finds real user comments using AI, and gets it ready to reply with your chosen message. It’s designed for long, messy pages and handles them reliably by breaking the content into smart chunks. Behind the scenes, it uses AI to tell genuine comments apart from LinkedIn’s UI (buttons, prompts, ads) and avoids replying to the original poster by mistake. It runs as a simple API you can call from your tools, and pairs nicely with a browser extension to act on LinkedIn through your browser.

## Description

This automation extracts real comments from a LinkedIn post and prepares replies by combining the page content (captured through your browser) with AI technology into a clean, structured result. It first pulls the full page content for the post, then uses AI to identify each commenter’s name, profile link, and actual comment text while ignoring LinkedIn interface elements like reaction buttons and “People also viewed.” In parallel, it processes large posts in chunks so it stays fast and doesn’t hit model limits. After filtering out the original poster and deduplicating repeated profiles, it returns a ready-to-review list of comments and a summary so you can confidently send consistent replies at scale.

## Key Features

**Real comment extraction**: Uses AI to find genuine user comments and ignore LinkedIn UI, reactions, ads, and prompts.

**Smart chunking for long pages**: Splits large pages into overlapping chunks to keep context and avoid missing replies.

**Original poster filtering**: Detects and skips the author’s own profile by URL and username to prevent accidental replies.

**Deduplication by profile**: Normalizes LinkedIn profile URLs and removes duplicates for clean, one-per-person results.

**Parallel processing**: Handles multiple chunks at once with safe concurrency limits for speed and reliability.

**Robust token management**: Conservatively estimates token usage and falls back to chunked processing if the content is huge.

**Clear, structured output**: Returns commenter name, profile URL, comment text, and a human-friendly summary you can review.

**Configurable models and fallbacks**: Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash via CodeWords Runtime with GPT‑4.1 as a quality fallback.
