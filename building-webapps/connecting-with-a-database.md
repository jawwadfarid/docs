# Connecting with a Database

### Key Features

Connecting **Supabase** gives your CodeWords app a full backend - data, users, files, and server-side logic without you having to wire everything up manually.

* **Database (PostgreSQL)**\
  Store and query app data with full SQL support. Describe what your app needs to remember, and Cody can create the right tables and schema for you.
* **User authentication**\
  Add secure sign-ups, logins, and access control. Cody can generate complete auth flows (like email/password) and connect them to the right pages and permissions.
* **File storage**\
  Upload and serve images and files through Supabase Storage - useful for profile photos, attachments, and any user uploads your app supports.
* **Real-time updates**\
  Stream data changes live to connected users. This is ideal for features like chat, activity feeds, and dashboards that update instantly.
* **Edge Functions (serverless backend)**\
  Run custom backend logic on Supabase’s infrastructure using JavaScript/TypeScript. Cody can create and deploy functions for tasks like sending emails, processing payments, and integrating with external APIs.

### Why use CodeWords with Supabase?

Supabase gives you the backend building blocks—database, auth, storage, and server-side logic. CodeWords makes them easy to use without stitching together separate tools.

Instead of designing a UI in one place and setting up the backend somewhere else, you describe what you want in a conversation with Cody. Cody builds the interface and configures the Supabase pieces behind it—tables, permissions, and any supporting logic—so everything works together from the start.

For example, you can say:\
“Add a user feedback form and save responses to the database.”

Cody will generate the form UI and create the Supabase table to store submissions, in one flow. That’s the advantage: faster building, fewer integration problems, and a smoother path from idea to a working app—whether you’re new to this or shipping quickly as a power user.
