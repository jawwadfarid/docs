# How to Build

### Overview&#x20;

CodeWords helps you create complete applications with both the front-end and back-end.      Describe what you want in a conversation with **Cody, the CodeWords AI assistant**, and Cody generates a working app for you. Every app comes with a **live URL**, works across **desktop** **and** **mobile**, and supports real functionality like **saving data**, **connecting to external services**, **accepting** **payments.**

This page explains the **types of apps you can build with CodeWords**, what’s included out of the box, and how CodeWords compares to other website builders and no-code tools.

### Building process

You start with a conversation. Describe what you want to build, and Cody generates a live preview so you can immediately see your idea take shape. Refine it through quick iterations, adjusting content, layout, design, and features until it matches your vision.&#x20;

Cody manages the underlying logic, data flow, and processing to keep the build stable and scalable. The built-in checks help to catch edge cases early.

**Start a chat with Cody**

Describe the app-idea that you want to build, \
\
**Example**:&#x20;

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
"Build me a client portal where customers can log in, view their invoices, and download reports."
```
{% endcode %}

The more detail you give, the closer the first version will be to what you want — but you can always refine later.
{% endstep %}

&#x20;**Cody builds a live preview**

Once the app has been built, you can preview the app from the preview canvas, available to you.&#x20;

You can perform testing directly within the Canvas environment, as demonstrated in the video below. The showcased application includes sample test credentials and mock data for evaluation purposes.

If you require a production-ready setup with persistent user management and data storage, please refer to the [database(with Supabase)](https://docs.codewords.ai/building-webapps/database-with-supabase) documentation for database configuration and integration details.

### Types of apps you can build with CodeWords

With CodeWords, you can build:

* **Business dashboards** that track KPIs, visualize metrics, and pull from live data sources
* **Internal tools** for teams, including admin panels, content queues, project boards, and ops workflows
* **SaaS applications** with user accounts, subscription billing, and third-party integrations
* **Client portals** where customers log in to view and manage their data securely
* **AI-powered tools** that generate content, analyze documents, summarize information, or draft smart replies
* **Landing pages and conversion tools** like lead capture forms, pricing calculators, booking flows, and sign-up pages

If you can describe the app you want to build, Cody can create it - no wireframes, technical specs, or prior experience required.

### What every app includes

Every CodeWords app comes with a live URL on `your-name.codewords.run` with an option to have a custom domain. The app will be in a mobile-responsive layout, and a library of 50+ pre-built UI components and also include automatic HTTPS encryption and polished social preview cards when someone shares your link.

### How CodeWords compares

**Website builders (Wix, Squarespace):**

Traditional website builders are optimized for static pages. CodeWords is built for applications, products that store data, run workflows, manage users, and connect to services.

**No-code platforms (Bubble, Retool):**

No-code tools give you a visual editor, but they still come with a learning curve. With CodeWords, you describe the outcome you want and Cody builds it. There’s no editor to master.

**Hiring a developer:**

Custom development can take weeks, cost thousands, and requires detailed specs. With CodeWords, you can get to a working version in minutes and iterate as often as you need.

**AI code tools (Cursor, Bolt):**

AI code generators still assume you can work with code and handle deployment. CodeWords delivers the full build end-to-end, hosting, updates, and implementation included, so you can stay focused on the product.
