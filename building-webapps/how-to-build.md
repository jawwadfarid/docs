# How to Build

### Overview&#x20;

CodeWords helps you create complete applications with both the front-end and back-end.      Describe what you want in a conversation with **Cody, the CodeWords AI assistant**, and Cody generates a working app for you. Every app comes with a **live URL**, works across **desktop** **and** **mobile**, and supports real functionality like **saving data**, **connecting to external services**, **accepting** **payments.**

This page explains the **types of apps you can build with CodeWords**, what’s included out of the box, and how CodeWords compares to other website builders and no-code tools.

### Building process

You start with a conversation. Describe what you want to build, and Cody generates a live preview so you can immediately see your idea take shape. Refine it through quick iterations adjusting content, layout, design, and features until it matches your vision.&#x20;

Cody manages the underlying logic, data flow, and processing to keep the build stable and scalable. The built-in checks hels to catch edge cases early.

### Types of apps you can build with CodeWords

With CodeWords, you can build:

* **Business dashboards** that track KPIs, visualize metrics, and pull from live data sources
* **Internal tools** for teams, including admin panels, content queues, project boards, and ops workflows
* **SaaS applications** with user accounts, subscription billing, and third-party integrations
* **Client portals** where customers log in to view and manage their data securely
* **AI-powered tools** that generate content, analyze documents, summarize information, or draft smart replies
* **Landing pages and conversion tools** like lead capture forms, pricing calculators, booking flows, and sign-up pages

If you can describe the app you want to build, Cody can create it - no wireframes, technical specs, or prior experience required.
